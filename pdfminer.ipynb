Vidula  (Medicine):  A  41-year-old  woman  presented  to  this  hospital \\nwith chest pain.\\n\\nApproximately 1 year before presentation, the patient had had transient tight-\\nness  in  the  chest  and  shoulder  on  the  left  side  that  had  prompted  a  referral  to \\noutpatient physical therapy. Five days before presentation, while the patient was \\npacking  for  a  flight  to  Boston,  acute  substernal  chest  pain  developed;  the  pain \\nradiated to the jaw and shoulders and was accompanied by dyspnea and by a feel-\\ning of needing to belch. These symptoms lasted 1 hour and then spontaneously \\nresolved, and she attributed them to fatigue.\\n\\nOn the day before presentation, substernal chest pain with radiation to the jaw \\nand shoulders recurred after the patient had been walking, and the pain gradually \\nresolved after a few hours. Before dinner on the evening of presentation, the pain \\nrecurred and was associated with light-headedness. The patient attended dinner \\nbut had persistent pain, along with dyspnea. She presented to the emergency de-\\npartment of this hospital.\\n\\nOn  physical  examination,  the  patient  was  diaphoretic.  The  temperature  was \\n36.6°C, the heart rate 68 beats per minute, the blood pressure 143/87 mm Hg in \\nboth arms, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation \\n100% while she was breathing ambient air. She did not have carotid bruits or \\njugular venous distention, nor did she have cardiac murmur, rub, or gallop on \\nauscultation. Her digits were hyperextensible. The rest of the examination was \\nnormal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\\n\\nThe patient had no history of dysrhythmia, heart-failure symptoms, trauma, or \\nconstitutional, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or neurologic symptoms. She had un-\\ndergone a laparoscopy for an ovarian cyst, and she had had a miscarriage 1 month \\nbefore this evaluation. She took no medications. Penicillin and sulfa drugs caused \\nurticaria. She exercised four times weekly with an elliptical machine and walked \\nher dog daily.

Symptoms  occurred \\ntransiently 5 days before presentation, recurred \\nafter  exertion  1  day  before  presentation,  and \\nbecame persistent on the day of presentation.\\n\\nThe differential diagnosis of chest pain in a \\n\\nyoung woman is broad, but in this case, it can \\nbe narrowed quickly on the basis of the abnor-\\nmal findings on electrocardiography, the hypo-\\nkinesis  in  the  left  ventricular  wall  on  echocar-\\ndiography, and the acute elevation in the troponin \\nlevel,  findings  suggestive  of  myocardial  injury. \\nIn  the  presence  of  these  findings,  noncardiac \\ncauses of pain that are common in young women \\n(e.g., gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal \\nspasm, and musculoskeletal pain) are unlikely.\\n\\n Myopericarditis\\nCould this patient’s chest pain be due to myo-\\npericarditis? Myocarditis or myopericarditis can \\nresult in focal or global myocardial inflamma-\\ntion, necrosis, and dysfunction. Focal myocardi-\\ntis  is  often  suspected  in  patients  who  present \\nwith chest pain (which is sometimes associated \\nwith  heart  failure  or  a  viral  illness)  and  with \\nevidence of an acute coronary syndrome on elec-\\ntrocardiography or laboratory testing and who \\ndo  not  have  evidence  of  obstructive  coronary \\nartery disease on coronary angiography. The di-\\nagnosis  can  be  confirmed  with  the  use  of  car-\\ndiac magnetic resonance imaging.1,2 A diagnosis \\nof focal myocarditis would partially explain the \\npatient’s  chest  pain,  focal  wall-motion  abnor-\\nmality, and elevated troponin level.

It is also notable that her troponin level was \\nnear normal on presentation and rose to 0.21 ng \\nper deciliter 8 hours later. In patients with myo-\\ncarditis,  the  troponin  level  is  typically  elevated \\non presentation and stays the same or gradually \\ndecreases over a period of days.\\n\\nChest  pain  due  to  pericarditis  is  usually  de-\\nscribed as a sharp pleuritic pain that improves \\nwith  leaning  forward  and  worsens  with  lying \\ndown,  and  such  pain  was  not  present  in  this \\npatient. In patients with pericarditis, electrocar-\\ndiography typically shows diffuse, concave ST-\\nsegment elevations and PR-segment depressions \\nrather than the isolated ST-segment depressions \\nthat were seen in this case.\\n\\nPulmonary Embolism\\nPulmonary embolism is often considered in pa-\\ntients  who  present  with  acute  chest  pain.  The \\nWells’ criteria help to establish whether the pre-\\ntest probability of pulmonary embolism is low, \\nintermediate, or high.3 These criteria include an \\nalternative diagnosis that is less likely than pul-\\nmonary  embolism,  clinical  signs  of  deep-vein \\nthrombosis,  previous  deep-vein  thrombosis  or \\npulmonary  embolism,  a  heart  rate  higher  than \\n100 beats per minute, surgery or immobilization \\nwithin  the  previous  4  weeks,  hemoptysis,  and \\nactive cancer. This patient does not meet any of \\nthese criteria. Moreover, patients with pulmo-\\nnary embolism have pleuritic chest pain more \\noften than substernal chest pain that radiates to \\nthe jaw and shoulders. Evidence of strain on the \\nright  side  of  the  heart  on  electrocardiography \\n(i.e., a S1Q3T3 pattern, with prominence of the \\nS wave in lead I and a Q-wave and T-wave inver-\\nsion in lead III) may be consistent with a diagno-\\nsis of pulmonary embolism, but it is uncommon, \\nand pulmonary embolism can be associated with \\nmany different abnormalities on electrocardiogra-\\nphy, including sinus tachycardia, anterior T-wave \\ninversions,4 new right bundle-branch block, and \\nnew  atrial  fibrillation.  An  elevated  troponin \\nlevel can be seen in patients with a large pulmo-\\nnary embolism due to strain on the right side of \\nthe heart; in such patients, one might expect to \\nsee McConnell’s sign on echocardiography (i.e., \\nhypokinesis at the base and middle of the right \\nventricle  with  relative  sparing  of  the  apex).5  I \\n\\nwould consider a diagnosis of pulmonary embo-\\nlism to be unlikely in this patient.\\n\\nVasospasm\\nVasospasm  of  the  coronary  arteries  can  cause \\nchest pain, most often when the patient is at rest. \\nVasospasm typically occurs for a period of 5 to \\n10 minutes, but when it is prolonged, it can re-\\nsult in myocardial injury. Chest pain related to \\nvasospasm usually resolves with the administra-\\ntion of sublingual nitroglycerin. Electrocardiog-\\nraphy can show ST-segment depressions or ST-\\nsegment elevations that mimic those seen with \\nacute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. \\nPatients who present with vasospasm often have \\nother vasoactive diagnoses, such as migraine or \\nRaynaud’s phenomenon. This patient has neither \\nof these conditions and there is no mention that \\nher chest pain was responsive to nitrates; there-\\nfore, this diagnosis is unlikely.\\n\\nTakotsubo Cardiomyopathy\\nPatients  who  have  takotsubo  cardiomyopathy, \\nwhich  is  also  known  as  stress-induced  cardio-\\nmyopathy  or  the  apical  ballooning  syndrome, \\noften present with chest pain, changes on elec-\\ntrocardiography, and an elevated troponin level. \\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy most commonly oc-\\ncurs in postmenopausal women and is usually \\nprecipitated by an intense physical or emotional \\nstressor. Electrocardiography most often shows \\nST-segment elevations or deep, symmetric T-wave \\ninversions; echocardiography typically shows hy-\\nperkinesis  at  the  base  of  the  left  ventricle  and \\nakinesis at the apex. Patients who present with \\nsymptoms and signs of takotsubo cardiomyopa-\\nthy often undergo urgent coronary angiography, \\nand the diagnosis is made after coronary obstruc-\\ntion  is  ruled  out  and  ventriculography  shows \\nakinesis at the apex of the left ventricle. On the \\nbasis of the patient’s age, the absence of an in-\\nciting event, and the presence of a small, focal \\nwall-motion  abnormality  on  echocardiography, \\ntakotsubo cardiomyopathy is an unlikely diagno-\\nsis in this case.\\n\\nAortic Dissection\\nWhen  this  patient  presented  to  the  emergency \\ndepartment, aortic dissection was appropriately \\nconsidered and CT angiography was performed. \\nAlthough the patient had not previously received \\n\\n2478\\n\\nn engl j med 377;25  nejm.org  December 21, 2017\\n\\nThe New England Journal of MedicineDownloaded from nejm.org by Chelsea Joe on October 9, 2024.

However, I believe this \\ndiagnosis is unlikely in this patient. She has no \\ntraditional  risk  factors  for  atherosclerosis,  and \\npatients  who  present  with  premature  coronary \\nartery disease typically have a strong family his-\\ntory of the disease, a history of tobacco use, or a \\nmarkedly elevated level of low-density–lipoprotein \\ncholesterol.\\n\\nSpontaneous Coronary-Artery Dissection\\nSeveral features of this case arouse suspicion for \\nspontaneous coronary-artery dissection, which \\naccounts for up to 30% of acute coronary syn-\\ndromes that occur in women younger than 50 \\nyears  of  age.9  In  this  patient,  clinical  features \\nthat  are  consistent  with  this  diagnosis  include \\nthe absence of traditional cardiac risk factors, a \\nhistory of recent miscarriage, a family history of \\nthe Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, and hyperextensible \\ndigits on physical examination. Certain hormonal \\ninfluences  are  thought  to  increase  the  risk  of \\nspontaneous coronary-artery dissection, because \\nmany patients receive the diagnosis during either \\nlate pregnancy or the early postpartum period. \\nAlthough this patient was not pregnant or in the \\npostpartum period, she had had a miscarriage \\n1 month before presentation, and the increased \\nprogesterone levels during that pregnancy could \\nhave  led  to  increased  fragility  of  the  arterial \\n\\nmedia. In addition, her family history of hyper-\\nmobility, spontaneous pneumothorax, and cere-\\nbral  aneurysm  raises  the  question  of  whether \\nshe and her family carry a genetic mutation that \\nincreases the risk of a coronary-artery dissection. \\nIn one series of patients with spontaneous coro-\\nnary-artery dissection, nearly one third had hy-\\npermobility  on  presentation.10  Risk  factors  for \\nspontaneous coronary-artery dissection that this \\npatient  did  not  have  include  intense  physical \\nactivity, emotional stress, fibromuscular dyspla-\\nsia, and systemic inflammatory conditions.\\n\\nIn patients who are hemodynamically stable \\nand have improving or resolved chest pain, the \\ndiagnosis  of  spontaneous  coronary-artery  dis-\\nsection can be made with the use of cardiac CT \\nangiography. In patients with unremitting chest \\npain or in those who have nondiagnostic results \\non  cardiac  CT  angiography,  invasive  coronary \\nangiography is often performed, but there is a \\nrisk  that  introduction  of  the  catheter  into  the \\ncoronary artery will propagate the dissection. Be-\\ncause this patient had ongoing chest pain, I would \\nrecommend invasive coronary angiography. Given \\nthe  distribution  of  the  wall-motion  abnormali-\\nties on echocardiography, I suspect that the pa-\\ntient  had  a  spontaneous  dissection  in  the  left \\ncircumflex coronary artery.\\n\\nDr. David M. Dudzinski (Cardiology): Dr. Vidula, \\nwhat  was  your  impression  when  you  evaluated \\nthis patient?\\n\\nDr. Vidula: Our differential diagnosis included \\nspontaneous coronary-artery dissection, acute myo-\\ncardial infarction due to plaque rupture, aortic \\ndissection, pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, and \\nvasospasm. Given her young age, the absence of \\natherosclerotic risk factors, and the family his-\\ntory of the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, we thought \\nthat the most likely diagnosis was spontaneous \\ncoronary-artery dissection.

Coronary Angiogram.\\nAn angiogram of the left coronary artery was obtained \\nin the right anterior oblique caudal view (Panel A). Dif‑\\nfuse narrowing of the vessel lumen (arrow) and a fill‑\\ning defect (oval) are visible in the first obtuse marginal \\nbranch of the left circumflex coronary artery; these \\nfindings are consistent with an intimal tear and type 1 \\ncoronary‑artery dissection. An angiogram of the left \\ncoronary artery was also obtained in the left anterior \\noblique caudal view (Panel B). Evidence of initiation of a \\ncoronary‑artery dissection is visible in the first obtuse \\nmarginal branch, including narrowing of the vessel lu‑\\nmen (arrow) and staining of the vessel wall (circle); \\ntortuosity of the coronary arteries is also shown.\\n\\nformed. After injection of contrast material into \\nthe left main coronary artery (see Videos 3 and 4), \\na filling defect was identified in the first obtuse \\nmarginal branch of the left circumflex coronary \\nartery  (Fig.  2).  There  was  evidence  of  sudden, \\ndiffuse  narrowing  of  the  vessel  lumen  and  an \\nirregular filling pattern, with preserved but de-\\nlayed distal filling (Thrombolysis in Myocardial \\nInfarction [TIMI] flow grade, 2 out of 3); these \\nfindings  were  consistent  with  coronary-artery \\ndissection.\\n\\nCoronary-artery dissection can be differenti-\\nated from atherosclerotic plaque rupture on the \\nbasis of the following features: the vessel wall \\nis stained with contrast material and the lesion \\nis  longer  and  has  a  characteristic  appearance. \\nCoronary-artery  dissection  is  frequently  associ-\\nated with the presence of excessive tortuosity of \\nthe coronary arteries. Distinct subtypes of spon-\\ntaneous  coronary-artery  dissection  have  been \\ndescribed. Type 1 dissection, which was seen in \\nthis patient, is associated with a characteristic \\nstaining  pattern  within  the  vessel  wall  that  is \\nconsistent  with  intimal  disruption.  Type  2  dis-\\nsection  is  characterized  by  a  diffuse,  smooth \\npattern of luminal narrowing. Type 3 dissection, \\nwhich mimics atherosclerosis, is associated with \\nfocal segments of luminal narrowing. Type 3 dis-\\nsection is uncommon, and intravascular ultra-\\nsonography  or  optical  coherence  tomography \\nmay  be  performed  to  establish  the  diagnosis \\nwith certainty.11\\n\\nSpontaneous coronary-artery dissection should \\nbe a strong consideration in a young woman or \\nman who does not have traditional cardiac risk \\nfactors and who presents with an acute coronary \\nsyndrome. The initial evaluation should include \\nelectrocardiography  and  measurement  of  the \\ntroponin  level,  as  well  as  echocardiography  to \\nevaluate for a possible wall-motion abnormality. \\nChest  pain  should  be  treated  with  sublingual \\nnitroglycerin,  and  if  there  is  no  improvement, \\ncoronary  angiography  may  be  performed.

Placement of a guidewire for percutaneous \\ncoronary intervention can be technically diffi-\\ncult  and  can  lead  to  abrupt  vessel  closure  or \\npropagation of the dissection.12\\n\\nCurrently,  few  data  support  the  use  of  anti-\\natherosclerotic medications in the management \\nof spontaneous coronary-artery dissection. Most \\nexperienced  clinicians  support  the  use  of  low-\\ndose aspirin (80 to 100 mg daily) in all patients \\nwith spontaneous coronary-artery dissection and \\nthe use of dual antiplatelet therapy in those who \\nundergo  percutaneous  coronary  intervention; \\nthrombolytic  therapy,  long-term  therapy  with \\nheparin,  and  therapy  with  glycoprotein  IIb/IIIa \\ninhibitors are otherwise typically avoided. Beta-\\nblockers and angiotensin-converting–enzyme in-\\nhibitors may be used selectively in patients with \\nongoing angina or heart failure.12,13 Statin ther-\\napy  is  not  typically  used  for  the  treatment  of \\nspontaneous coronary-artery dissection but may \\nbe initiated in patients who have other indications.\\nPatients  with  spontaneous  coronary-artery \\ndissection are usually referred for cardiac reha-\\nbilitation. Unique cardiac-rehabilitation programs \\nhave been designed for this typically fit, young \\ngroup of patients.14 Because there is a frequent \\nassociation between spontaneous coronary-artery \\ndissection and fibromuscular dysplasia, CT angi-\\nography of the head, neck, abdomen, and pelvis \\nis  recommended.  Genetic  testing  may  be  per-\\nformed when there is a family history of possible \\nconnective-tissue  disorders  or  evidence  of  con-\\nnective-tissue disorders on physical examination \\nor vascular screening; it may also be performed \\nat the patient’s request.11-13 Given the features of \\nthis patient’s presentation and the family history \\nof the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, we obtained ad-\\nditional imaging studies to rule out fibromuscu-\\nlar dysplasia and performed a genetic evaluation \\nto  determine  whether  an  underlying  genetic \\ncondition could explain her diagnosis.\\n\\nIm aging S t udie s\\n\\nDr. Ghoshhajra: CT angiography of the head, neck, \\nabdomen, and pelvis was performed to evaluate \\nfor  abnormalities  of  small  and  medium-sized \\nvessels.  The  vessels  in  the  head  and  neck  were \\npatent and had no evidence of aneurysm, dissec-\\ntion, or luminal irregularity, such as beading.\\n\\nThe  arterial-phase  abdominal  images  were \\n\\nslightly confounded by motion, but delayed-phase \\nimages showed multiple small, bilateral, wedge-\\nshaped cortical defects that were consistent with \\nremote  renal  infarctions  (Fig.  3A  and  3B).  On \\narterial-phase  abdominal  and  pelvic  images, \\npaired  right  and  single  left  renal  arteries  were \\nidentified,  all  of  which  had  subtle  luminal  ir-\\nregularities (Fig. 3C and 3D), findings consistent \\nwith previous renal-artery dissections. However, \\nthere  were  no  findings  that  would  specifically \\nsuggest fibromuscular dysplasia, such as bead-\\ning, stenosis, or aneurysm.\\n\\nGene t ic Te s t ing\\n\\nDr. Mark E. Lindsay:  It  is  common  to  perform  a \\ngenetic evaluation in patients with spontaneous \\ncoronary-artery  dissection  because  of  the  fre-\\nquent absence of traditional cardiac risk factors \\nin such patients and because of the known asso-\\nciation of arterial dissection with genetic disor-\\nders. Genetic diagnoses associated with sponta-\\nneous coronary-artery dissection include Marfan’s \\nsyndrome, the Loeys–Dietz syndrome, vascular \\nEhlers–Danlos syndrome, autosomal dominant \\npolycystic kidney disease, and probably others.10,15-18 \\nIn  this  case,  the  family  history  of  hypermobile \\nEhlers–Danlos  syndrome  further  motivated  the \\ngenetic evaluation. In general, the Ehlers–Danlos \\nsyndrome  is  not  associated  with  vascular  fea-\\ntures; however vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome \\n(type  4),  which  is  caused  by  disruption  of  the \\ngene  COL3A1,19  is  associated  with  nonaneurys-\\nmal  arterial  dissections.20  Therefore,  a  primary \\ngoal of the genetic evaluation in this case was \\nto discriminate specifically between a COL3A1–\\nassociated  syndrome  and  nonvascular  types  of \\nthe Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.\\n\\nThree  first-degree  family  members  had  the \\nEhlers–Danlos syndrome, with symptoms includ-\\ning  joint  dislocations  and  hypermobility.  How-\\never, the patient did not have joint dysfunction \\nor objective hypermobility (i.e., she had a score of \\n0 on the Beighton scale of hypermobility, which \\nranges from 0 to 9, with a score >4 indicating \\ngeneralized  flexibility).21  There  was  no  family \\nhistory of arterial dissection, hollow viscus rup-\\nture, sudden death, or emergency vascular sur-\\ngery. In short, the family history was only super-\\nficially  suggestive  of  vascular  Ehlers–Danlos \\nsyndrome, and the patient did not appear to be \\naffected by the familial joint condition.

A  further  consideration  in  this  case  was \\nthe  absence  of  fibromuscular  dysplasia.  Mono-\\ngenic  vascular  syndromes  have  not  been  found \\nto be associated with a vascular morphology that \\nis  characteristic  of  fibromuscular  dysplasia22,23; \\ntherefore, the absence of fibromuscular dyspla-\\nsia in this case somewhat increases the proba-\\nbility of an identifiable genetic disorder.\\n\\nNeither the examination nor the family his-\\ntory  was  suggestive  of  vascular  Ehlers–Danlos \\nsyndrome, but external inspection alone cannot \\ncompletely rule out this diagnosis, and the ab-\\nnormalities  of  the  renal  arteries  suggested  a \\nwidespread arteriopathy.

      "\n",
      "Approximately 1 year before presentation, the patient had had transient tightness in the chest and shoulder on the left side that had prompted a referral to outpatient physical therapy. Five days before presentation, while the patient was packing for a flight to Boston, acute substernal chest pain developed; the pain radiated to the jaw and shoulders and was accompanied by dyspnea and by a feeling of needing to belch. These symptoms lasted 1 hour and then spontaneously resolved, and she attributed them to fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the day before presentation, substernal chest pain with radiation to the jaw and shoulders recurred after the patient had been walking, and the pain gradually resolved after a few hours. Before dinner on the evening of presentation, the pain recurred and was associated with light-headedness. The patient attended dinner but had persistent pain, along with dyspnea. She presented to the emergency department of this hospital.\n",

      "On physical examination, the patient was diaphoretic. The temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 68 beats per minute, the blood pressure 143/87 mm Hg in both arms, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. She did not have carotid bruits or jugular venous distention, nor did she have cardiac murmur, rub, or gallop on auscultation. Her digits were hyperextensible. The rest of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\n",

Symptoms occurred transiently 5 days before presentation, recurred after exertion 1 day before presentation, and young woman is broad, but in this case, it can be narrowed quickly on the basis of the abnormal findings on electrocardiography, the hypokinesis in the left ventricular wall on echocardiography, and the acute elevation in the troponin level, findings suggestive of myocardial injury. In the presence of these findings, noncardiac causes of pain that are common in young women (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal spasm, and musculoskeletal pain) are unlikely.\n",

      "#### Myopericarditis\n",
      "\n",
      "Could this patient's chest pain be due to myopericarditis? Myocarditis or myopericarditis can result in focal or global myocardial inflammation, necrosis, and dysfunction. Focal myocarditis is often suspected in patients who present with chest pain (which is sometimes associated with heart failure or a viral illness) and with evidence of an acute coronary syndrome on electrocardiography or laboratory testing and who do not have evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease on coronary angiography. The diagnosis can be confirmed with the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.1,2 A diagnosis of focal myocarditis would partially explain the patient's chest pain, focal wall-motion abnormality, and elevated troponin level. However, the were performed, and a diagnosis was made.\n",

      "patient did not describe any antecedent viral illness, which might lead us to suspect myocarditis. It is also notable that her troponin level was near normal on presentation and rose to 0.21 ng per deciliter 8 hours later. In patients with myocarditis, the troponin level is typically elevated on presentation and stays the same or gradually decreases over a period of days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chest pain due to pericarditis is usually described as a sharp pleuritic pain that improves with leaning forward and worsens with lying down, and such pain was not present in this patient. In patients with pericarditis, electrocardiography typically shows diffuse, concave ST- segment elevations and PR-segment depressions rather than the isolated ST-segment depressions that were seen in this case.\n",

      "#### Pulmonary Embolism\n",
      "\n",
      "would consider a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism to be unlikely in this patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Vasospasm\n",
      "\n",
      "Vasospasm of the coronary arteries can cause chest pain, most often when the patient is at rest. Vasospasm typically occurs for a period of 5 to 10 minutes, but when it is prolonged, it can result in myocardial injury. Chest pain related to vasospasm usually resolves with the administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. Electrocardiography can show ST-segment depressions or ST- segment elevations that mimic those seen with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Patients who present with vasospasm often have other vasoactive diagnoses, such as migraine or Raynaud's phenomenon. This patient has neither of these conditions and there is no mention that her chest pain was responsive to nitrates; there-\n",
      "Pulmonary embolism is often considered in patients who present with acute chest pain. The Wells' criteria help to establish whether the pretest probability of pulmonary embolism is low, intermediate, or high.3 These criteria include an alternative diagnosis that is less likely than pulmonary embolism, clinical signs of deep-vein thrombosis, previous deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, a heart rate higher than 100 beats per minute, surgery or immobilization within the previous 4 weeks, hemoptysis, and active cancer. This patient does not meet any of these criteria. Moreover, patients with pulmonary embolism have pleuritic chest pain more often than substernal chest pain that radiates to the jaw and shoulders. Evidence of strain on the right side of the heart on electrocardiography (i.e., a S1Q3T3 pattern, with prominence of the S wave in lead I and a Q-wave and T-wave inversion in lead III) may be consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, but it is uncommon, and pulmonary embolism can be associated with many different abnormalities on electrocardiography, including sinus tachycardia, anterior T-wave inversions,4 new right bundle-branch block, and new atrial fibrillation. An elevated troponin level can be seen in patients with a large pulmonary embolism due to strain on the right side of the heart; in such patients, one might expect to see McConnell's sign on echocardiography (i.e., hypokinesis at the base and middle of the right ventricle with relative sparing of the apex).5 I \n",
      "fore, this diagnosis is unlikely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Patients who have takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or the apical ballooning syndrome, often present with chest pain, changes on electrocardiography, and an elevated troponin level. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy most commonly occurs in postmenopausal women and is usually precipitated by an intense physical or emotional stressor. Electrocardiography most often shows ST-segment elevations or deep, symmetric T-wave inversions; echocardiography typically shows hyperkinesis at the base of the left ventricle and akinesis at the apex. Patients who present with symptoms and signs of takotsubo cardiomyopathy often undergo urgent coronary angiography, and the diagnosis is made after coronary obstruction is ruled out and ventriculography shows akinesis at the apex of the left ventricle. On the basis of the patient's age, the absence of an inciting event, and the presence of a small, focal wall-motion abnormality on echocardiography, takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an unlikely diagnosis in this case.\n",

      "Aortic Dissection When this patient presented to the emergency department, aortic dissection was appropriately considered and CT angiography was performed. Although the patient had not previously received \n",
      "\n",
      "a diagnosis of hypertension, which is seen in most patients with aortic dissection, she had a family history of hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. Hypermobility is seen with several types of the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, including the hypermobile, classical, and vascular types.6 Vascular complications, such as aortic dissection, are common only with the vascular type (but have been reported with other types), and aortic-root dilatation can be seen with both the classical type and the hypermobile type.7,8 Unless the patient had an aortic dissection with involvement of the coronary arteries, this diagnosis would not explain the dynamic changes on electrocardiography or elevated troponin level seen in this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Atherosclerotic Coronary Artery Disease\n",
      "\n",
      "Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease should be considered in any patient who meets diagnostic criteria for acute myocardial infarction, including symptoms of ischemia, an acute elevation in the troponin level, and new ischemic changes on electrocardiography. However, I believe this diagnosis is unlikely in this patient. She has no traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis, and patients who present with premature coronary artery disease typically have a strong family history of the disease, a history of tobacco use, or a markedly elevated level of low-density–lipoprotein cholesterol.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Spontaneous Coronary-Artery Dissection\n",
      "\n",
      "Several features of this case arouse suspicion for spontaneous coronary-artery dissection, which accounts for up to 30% of acute coronary syndromes that occur in women younger than 50 years of age.9 In this patient, clinical features that are consistent with this diagnosis include the absence of traditional cardiac risk factors, a history of recent miscarriage, a family history of the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, and hyperextensible digits on physical examination. Certain hormonal influences are thought to increase the risk of spontaneous coronary-artery dissection, because many patients receive the diagnosis during either late pregnancy or the early postpartum period. Although this patient was not pregnant or in the postpartum period, she had had a miscarriage 1 month before presentation, and the increased progesterone levels during that pregnancy could have led to increased fragility of the arterial media. In addition, her family history of hypermobility, spontaneous pneumothorax, and cerebral aneurysm raises the question of whether she and her family carry a genetic mutation that increases the risk of a coronary-artery dissection. In one series of patients with spontaneous coronary-artery dissection, nearly one third had hypermobility on presentation.10 Risk factors for spontaneous coronary-artery dissection that this patient did not have include intense physical activity, emotional stress, fibromuscular dysplasia, and systemic inflammatory conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In patients who are hemodynamically stable and have improving or resolved chest pain, the diagnosis of spontaneous coronary-artery dissection can be made with the use of cardiac CT angiography. In patients with unremitting chest pain or in those who have nondiagnostic results on cardiac CT angiography, invasive coronary angiography is often performed, but there is a risk that introduction of the catheter into the coronary artery will propagate the dissection. Because this patient had ongoing chest pain, I would recommend invasive coronary angiography. Given the distribution of the wall-motion abnormalities on echocardiography, I suspect that the patient had a spontaneous dissection in the left circumflex coronary artery.\n",

Given her young age, the absence of atherosclerotic risk factors, and the family history of the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, we thought that the most likely diagnosis was spontaneous coronary-artery dissection. To confirm this diagnosis, we performed coronary angiography.\n",

Dif‑ fuse narrowing of the vessel lumen (arrow) and a fill‑ ing defect (oval) are visible in the first obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex coronary artery; these findings are consistent with an intimal tear and type 1 coronary‑artery dissection. An angiogram of the left coronary artery was also obtained in the left anterior oblique caudal view (Panel B). Evidence of initiation of a coronary‑artery dissection is visible in the first obtuse marginal branch, including narrowing of the vessel lu‑ men (arrow) and staining of the vessel wall (circle); tortuosity of the coronary arteries is also shown.\n",

After injection of contrast material into the left main coronary artery (see Videos 3 and 4), a filling defect was identified in the first obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex coronary artery (Fig. 2). There was evidence of sudden, diffuse narrowing of the vessel lumen and an irregular filling pattern, with preserved but delayed distal filling (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] flow grade, 2 out of 3); these findings were consistent with coronary-artery dissection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coronary-artery dissection can be differentiated from atherosclerotic plaque rupture on the basis of the following features: the vessel wall is stained with contrast material and the lesion is longer and has a characteristic appearance. Coronary-artery dissection is frequently associated with the presence of excessive tortuosity of the coronary arteries. Distinct subtypes of spontaneous coronary-artery dissection have been described. Type 1 dissection, which was seen in this patient, is associated with a characteristic staining pattern within the vessel wall that is consistent with intimal disruption. Type 2 dissection is characterized by a diffuse, smooth pattern of luminal narrowing. Type 3 dissection, which mimics atherosclerosis, is associated with focal segments of luminal narrowing. Type 3 dissection is uncommon, and intravascular ultrasonography or optical coherence tomography may be performed to establish the diagnosis with certainty.11 Spontaneous coronary-artery dissection should be a strong consideration in a young woman or man who does not have traditional cardiac risk factors and who presents with an acute coronary syndrome. The initial evaluation should include electrocardiography and measurement of the troponin level, as well as echocardiography to evaluate for a possible wall-motion abnormality. Chest pain should be treated with sublingual nitroglycerin, and if there is no improvement, coronary angiography may be performed. In clinically stable patients who are pain-free and do not have evidence of ST-segment elevation, cardiac CT angiography may be considered.\n",

Placement of a guidewire for percutaneous coronary intervention can be technically difficult and can lead to abrupt vessel closure or propagation of the dissection.12 Currently, few data support the use of antiatherosclerotic medications in the management of spontaneous coronary-artery dissection. Most experienced clinicians support the use of lowdose aspirin (80 to 100 mg daily) in all patients with spontaneous coronary-artery dissection and the use of dual antiplatelet therapy in those who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention; thrombolytic therapy, long-term therapy with heparin, and therapy with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are otherwise typically avoided. Betablockers and angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors may be used selectively in patients with ongoing angina or heart failure.12,13 Statin therapy is not typically used for the treatment of spontaneous coronary-artery dissection but may be initiated in patients who have other indications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients with spontaneous coronary-artery dissection are usually referred for cardiac rehabilitation. Unique cardiac-rehabilitation programs have been designed for this typically fit, young group of patients.14 Because there is a frequent association between spontaneous coronary-artery dissection and fibromuscular dysplasia, CT angiography of the head, neck, abdomen, and pelvis is recommended. Genetic testing may be performed when there is a family history of possible connective-tissue disorders or evidence of connective-tissue disorders on physical examination or vascular screening; it may also be performed at the patient's request.11-13 Given the features of this patient's presentation and the family history of the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, we obtained additional imaging studies to rule out fibromuscular dysplasia and performed a genetic evaluation to determine whether an underlying genetic condition could explain her diagnosis.\n",

      "\n",
      "The arterial-phase abdominal images were slightly confounded by motion, but delayed-phase images showed multiple small, bilateral, wedgeshaped cortical defects that were consistent with remote renal infarctions (Fig. 3A and 3B). On arterial-phase abdominal and pelvic images, paired right and single left renal arteries were identified, all of which had subtle luminal irregularities (Fig. 3C and 3D), findings consistent with previous renal-artery dissections. However, there were no findings that would specifically suggest fibromuscular dysplasia, such as beading, stenosis, or aneurysm.\n",

      "# Genetic Testing\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Mark E. Lindsay: It is common to perform a genetic evaluation in patients with spontaneous coronary-artery dissection because of the frequent absence of traditional cardiac risk factors in such patients and because of the known association of arterial dissection with genetic disorders. Genetic diagnoses associated with spontaneous coronary-artery dissection include Marfan's syndrome, the Loeys–Dietz syndrome, vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and probably others.10,15-18 In this case, the family history of hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome further motivated the genetic evaluation. In general, the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome is not associated with vascular features; however vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (type 4), which is caused by disruption of the gene *COL3A1*,\n",
      "19 is associated with nonaneurysmal arterial dissections.20 Therefore, a primary goal of the genetic evaluation in this case was to discriminate specifically between a *COL3A1*– associated syndrome and nonvascular types of the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.\n",

      "Three first-degree family members had the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, with symptoms including joint dislocations and hypermobility. However, the patient did not have joint dysfunction or objective hypermobility (i.e., she had a score of 0 on the Beighton scale of hypermobility, which ranges from 0 to 9, with a score >4 indicating generalized flexibility).21 There was no family history of arterial dissection, hollow viscus rupture, sudden death, or emergency vascular surgery. In short, the family history was only superficially suggestive of vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, and the patient did not appear to be affected by the familial joint condition. The ab-\n",

A further consideration in this case was the absence of fibromuscular dysplasia. Monogenic vascular syndromes have not been found to be associated with a vascular morphology that is characteristic of fibromuscular dysplasia22,23; therefore, the absence of fibromuscular dysplasia in this case somewhat increases the probability of an identifiable genetic disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither the examination nor the family history was suggestive of vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, but external inspection alone cannot completely rule out this diagnosis, and the abnormalities of the renal arteries suggested a widespread arteriopathy. Given the patient's risk profile and her desire to assess familial risk, we recommended molecular genetic testing. After formal genetic counseling was provided and written informed consent was obtained, a blood sample was obtained for testing with a comprehensive panel of genes associated with aortopathy. The testing included sequencing and deletion and duplication analysis of 23 genes reportedly involved in arterial disease, including *COL3A1*\n",

Five days before presentation, while the patient was packing for a flight to Boston, acute substernal chest pain developed; the pain radiated to the jaw and shoulders and was accompanied by dyspnea and by a feeling of needing to belch. These symptoms lasted 1 hour and then spontaneously resolved, and she attributed them to fatigue.\n",

There was a small, focal area of hypokinesis in the left ventricular inferolateral wall (see Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). There was no clinically significant valvular stenosis, regurgitation, or pericardial effusion. Although there was increased mobility of the interatrial septum, a color Doppler study showed no evidence of a patent foramen ovale.\n",
      "\n",

Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the chest was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material with the use of a standard aortic-dissection protocol. There was no evidence of aortic dissection or proximal pulmonary embolism. The aorta appeared normal, with a preserved sinotubular junction, and the ascending aorta and descending aorta each had a normal diameter. There were no other obvious cardiovascular abnormalities, such as aortic or coronary atherosclerosis, cardiomegaly, or pulmonary edema.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Differential Diagnosis\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Sarah V. Tsiaras: This previously healthy 41-year-old woman, who had no history of a medical condition and no traditional cardiac risk factors, presented with acute chest pain that radiated to her jaw and shoulders and was associated with dyspnea and diaphoresis. Symptoms occurred transiently 5 days before presentation, recurred after exertion 1 day before presentation, and became persistent on the day of presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The differential diagnosis of chest pain in a young woman is broad, but in this case, it can be narrowed quickly on the basis of the abnormal findings on electrocardiography, the hypokinesis in the left ventricular wall on echocardiography, and the acute elevation in the troponin level, findings suggestive of myocardial injury. In the presence of these findings, noncardiac causes of pain that are common in young women (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal spasm, and musculoskeletal pain) are unlikely.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Myopericarditis\n",
      "\n",
      "Could this patient's chest pain be due to myopericarditis? Myocarditis or myopericarditis can result in focal or global myocardial inflammation, necrosis, and dysfunction. Focal myocarditis is often suspected in patients who present with chest pain (which is sometimes associated with heart failure or a viral illness) and with evidence of an acute coronary syndrome on electrocardiography or laboratory testing and who do not have evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease on coronary angiography. The diagnosis can be confirmed with the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A diagnosis of focal myocarditis would partially explain the patient's chest pain, focal wall-motion abnormality, and elevated troponin level. However, the patient did not describe any antecedent viral illness, which might lead us to suspect myocarditis. It is also notable that her troponin level was near normal on presentation and rose to 0.21 ng per deciliter 8 hours later. In patients with myocarditis, the troponin level is typically elevated on presentation and stays the same or gradually decreases over a period of days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chest pain due to pericarditis is usually described as a sharp pleuritic pain that improves with leaning forward and worsens with lying down, and such pain was not present in this patient. In patients with pericarditis, electrocardiography typically shows diffuse, concave ST-segment elevations and PR-segment depressions rather than the isolated ST-segment depressions that were seen in this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Pulmonary Embolism\n",
      "\n",
      "Pulmonary embolism is often considered in patients who present with acute chest pain. The Wells' criteria help to establish whether the pretest probability of pulmonary embolism is low, intermediate, or high. These criteria include an alternative diagnosis that is less likely than pulmonary embolism, clinical signs of deep-vein thrombosis, previous deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, a heart rate higher than 100 beats per minute, surgery or immobilization within the previous 4 weeks, hemoptysis, and active cancer. This patient does not meet any of these criteria. Moreover, patients with pulmonary embolism have pleuritic chest pain more often than substernal chest pain that radiates to the jaw and shoulders. Evidence of strain on the right side of the heart on electrocardiography (i.e., a S1Q3T3 pattern, with prominence of the S wave in lead I and a Q-wave and T-wave inversion in lead III) may be consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, but it is uncommon, and pulmonary embolism can be associated with many different abnormalities on electrocardiography, including sinus tachycardia, anterior T-wave inversions, new right bundle-branch block, and new atrial fibrillation. An elevated troponin level can be seen in patients with a large pulmonary embolism due to strain on the right side of the heart; in such patients, one might expect to see McConnell's sign on echocardiography (i.e., hypokinesis at the base and middle of the right ventricle with relative sparing of the apex). I would consider a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism to be unlikely in this patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Vasospasm\n",
      "\n",
      "Vasospasm of the coronary arteries can cause chest pain, most often when the patient is at rest. Vasospasm typically occurs for a period of 5 to 10 minutes, but when it is prolonged, it can result in myocardial injury. Chest pain related to vasospasm usually resolves with the administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. Electrocardiography can show ST-segment depressions or ST-segment elevations that mimic those seen with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Patients who present with vasospasm often have other vasoactive diagnoses, such as migraine or Raynaud's phenomenon. This patient has neither of these conditions and there is no mention that her chest pain was responsive to nitrates; therefore, this diagnosis is unlikely.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients who have takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or the apical ballooning syndrome, often present with chest pain, changes on electrocardiography, and an elevated troponin level. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy most commonly occurs in postmenopausal women and is usually precipitated by an intense physical or emotional stressor. Electrocardiography most often shows ST-segment elevations or deep, symmetric T-wave inversions; echocardiography typically shows hyperkinesis at the base of the left ventricle and akinesis at the apex. Patients who present with symptoms and signs of takotsubo cardiomyopathy often undergo urgent coronary angiography, and the diagnosis is made after coronary obstruction is ruled out and ventriculography shows akinesis at the apex of the left ventricle. On the basis of the patient's age, the absence of an inciting event, and the presence of a small, focal wall-motion abnormality on echocardiography, takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an unlikely diagnosis in this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Aortic Dissection\n",
      "\n",
      "When this patient presented to the emergency department, aortic dissection was appropriately considered and CT angiography was performed. Although the patient had not previously received a diagnosis of hypertension, which is seen in most patients with aortic dissection, she had a family history of hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. Hypermobility is seen with several types of the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, including the hypermobile, classical, and vascular types. Vascular complications, such as aortic dissection, are common only with the vascular type (but have been reported with other types), and aortic-root dilatation can be seen with both the classical type and the hypermobile type. Unless the patient had an aortic dissection with involvement of the coronary arteries, this diagnosis would not explain the dynamic changes on electrocardiography or elevated troponin level seen in this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Atherosclerotic Coronary Artery Disease\n",
      "\n",
      "Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease should be considered in any patient who meets diagnostic criteria for acute myocardial infarction, including symptoms of ischemia, an acute elevation in the troponin level, and new ischemic changes on electrocardiography. However, I believe this diagnosis is unlikely in this patient. She has no traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis, and patients who present with premature coronary artery disease typically have a strong family history of the disease, a history of tobacco use, or a markedly elevated level of low-density–lipoprotein cholesterol.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Spontaneous Coronary-Artery Dissection\n",
      "\n",
      "Several features of this case arouse suspicion for spontaneous coronary-artery dissection, which accounts for up to 30% of acute coronary syndromes that occur in women younger than 50 years of age. In this patient, clinical features that are consistent with this diagnosis include the absence of traditional cardiac risk factors, a history of recent miscarriage, a family history of the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, and hyperextensible digits on physical examination. Certain hormonal influences are thought to increase the risk of spontaneous coronary-artery dissection, because many patients receive the diagnosis during either late pregnancy or the early postpartum period. Although this patient was not pregnant or in the postpartum period, she had had a miscarriage 1 month before presentation, and the increased progesterone levels during that pregnancy could have led to increased fragility of the arterial media. In addition, her family history of hypermobility, spontaneous pneumothorax, and cerebral aneurysm raises the question of whether she and her family carry a genetic mutation that increases the risk of a coronary-artery dissection. In one series of patients with spontaneous coronary-artery dissection, nearly one third had hypermobility on presentation. Risk factors for spontaneous coronary-artery dissection that this patient did not have include intense physical activity, emotional stress, fibromuscular dysplasia, and systemic inflammatory conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In patients who are hemodynamically stable and have improving or resolved chest pain, the diagnosis of spontaneous coronary-artery dissection can be made with the use of cardiac CT angiography. In patients with unremitting chest pain or in those who have nondiagnostic results on cardiac CT angiography, invasive coronary angiography is often performed, but there is a risk that introduction of the catheter into the coronary artery will propagate the dissection. Because this patient had ongoing chest pain, I would recommend invasive coronary angiography. Given the distribution of the wall-motion abnormalities on echocardiography, I suspect that the patient had a spontaneous dissection in the left circumflex coronary artery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. David M. Dudzinski (Cardiology): Dr. Vidula, what was your impression when you evaluated this patient?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Vidula: Our differential diagnosis included spontaneous coronary-artery dissection, acute myocardial infarction due to plaque rupture, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, and vasospasm. Given her young age, the absence of atherosclerotic risk factors, and the family history of the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, we thought that the most likely diagnosis was spontaneous coronary-artery dissection. To confirm this diagnosis, we performed coronary angiography.\n",

      "Spontaneous coronary-artery dissection.\n",

      "\n",
      "Figure 2. Coronary Angiogram. An angiogram of the left coronary artery was obtained in the right anterior oblique caudal view (Panel A). Diffuse narrowing of the vessel lumen (arrow) and a filling defect (oval) are visible in the first obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex coronary artery; these findings are consistent with an intimal tear and type 1 coronary-artery dissection. An angiogram of the left coronary artery was also obtained in the left anterior oblique caudal view (Panel B). Evidence of initiation of a coronary-artery dissection is visible in the first obtuse marginal branch, including narrowing of the vessel lumen (arrow) and staining of the vessel wall (circle); tortuosity of the coronary arteries is also shown.\n",
      "\n",
      "After injection of contrast material into the left main coronary artery (see Videos 3 and 4), a filling defect was identified in the first obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex coronary artery (Fig. 2). There was evidence of sudden, diffuse narrowing of the vessel lumen and an irregular filling pattern, with preserved but delayed distal filling (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] flow grade, 2 out of 3); these findings were consistent with coronary-artery dissection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coronary-artery dissection can be differentiated from atherosclerotic plaque rupture on the basis of the following features: the vessel wall is stained with contrast material and the lesion is longer and has a characteristic appearance. Coronary-artery dissection is frequently associated with the presence of excessive tortuosity of the coronary arteries. Distinct subtypes of spontaneous coronary-artery dissection have been described. Type 1 dissection, which was seen in this patient, is associated with a characteristic staining pattern within the vessel wall that is consistent with intimal disruption. Type 2 dissection is characterized by a diffuse, smooth pattern of luminal narrowing. Type 3 dissection, which mimics atherosclerosis, is associated with focal segments of luminal narrowing. Type 3 dissection is uncommon, and intravascular ultrasonography or optical coherence tomography may be performed to establish the diagnosis with certainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spontaneous coronary-artery dissection should be a strong consideration in a young woman or man who does not have traditional cardiac risk factors and who presents with an acute coronary syndrome. The initial evaluation should include electrocardiography and measurement of the troponin level, as well as echocardiography to evaluate for a possible wall-motion abnormality. Chest pain should be treated with sublingual nitroglycerin, and if there is no improvement, coronary angiography may be performed. In clinically stable patients who are pain-free and do not have evidence of ST-segment elevation, cardiac CT angiography may be considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Diagnostic Testing\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Malissa J. Wood: Catheterization of the left side of the heart and coronary angiography were performed.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Discussion Of Management\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Wood: After a coronary-artery dissection has been identified on coronary angiography, a conservative approach is typically warranted, particularly in the presence of preserved distal perfusion. Placement of a guidewire for percutaneous coronary intervention can be technically difficult and can lead to abrupt vessel closure or propagation of the dissection. \n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, few data support the use of antiatherosclerotic medications in the management of spontaneous coronary-artery dissection. Most experienced clinicians support the use of low-dose aspirin (80 to 100 mg daily) in all patients with spontaneous coronary-artery dissection and the use of dual antiplatelet therapy in those who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention; thrombolytic therapy, long-term therapy with heparin, and therapy with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are otherwise typically avoided. Beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors may be used selectively in patients with ongoing angina or heart failure. Statin therapy is not typically used for the treatment of spontaneous coronary-artery dissection but may be initiated in patients who have other indications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients with spontaneous coronary-artery dissection are usually referred for cardiac rehabilitation. Unique cardiac-rehabilitation programs have been designed for this typically fit, young group of patients. Because there is a frequent association between spontaneous coronary-artery dissection and fibromuscular dysplasia, CT angiography of the head, neck, abdomen, and pelvis is recommended. Genetic testing may be performed when there is a family history of possible connective-tissue disorders or evidence of connective-tissue disorders on physical examination or vascular screening; it may also be performed at the patient's request. Given the features of this patient's presentation and the family history of the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, we obtained additional imaging studies to rule out fibromuscular dysplasia and performed a genetic evaluation to determine whether an underlying genetic condition could explain her diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Imaging Studies\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Ghoshhajra: CT angiography of the head, neck, abdomen, and pelvis was performed to evaluate for abnormalities of small and medium-sized vessels. The vessels in the head and neck were patent and had no evidence of aneurysm, dissection, or luminal irregularity, such as beading.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arterial-phase abdominal images were slightly confounded by motion, but delayed-phase images showed multiple small, bilateral, wedge-shaped cortical defects that were consistent with remote renal infarctions (Fig. 3A and 3B). On arterial-phase abdominal and pelvic images, paired right and single left renal arteries were identified, all of which had subtle luminal irregularities (Fig. 3C and 3D), findings consistent with previous renal-artery dissections. However, there were no findings that would specifically suggest fibromuscular dysplasia, such as beading, stenosis, or aneurysm.\n",
      "\n",
      "![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 3. CT Angiogram. Oblique coronal reformatted multiplanar images showing the long axis of the right and left kidney (Panels A and B, respectively) were obtained during the delayed phase. Bilateral, wedge‑shaped cortical defects are visible (arrows); these findings are consistent with small, remote infarctions. Oblique coronal maximum‑intensity‑projection images showing the right and left renal arteries (Panels C and D, respectively) were obtained during the arterial phase. Paired right and single left renal arteries have subtle luminal irregularities (arrowheads).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Genetic Testing\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Mark E. Lindsay: It is common to perform a genetic evaluation in patients with spontaneous coronary-artery dissection because of the frequent absence of traditional cardiac risk factors in such patients and because of the known association of arterial dissection with genetic disorders. Genetic diagnoses associated with spontaneous coronary-artery dissection include Marfan's syndrome, the Loeys–Dietz syndrome, vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and probably others. In this case, the family history of hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome further motivated the genetic evaluation. In general, the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome is not associated with vascular features; however vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (type 4), which is caused by disruption of the gene *COL3A1*, is associated with nonaneurysmal arterial dissections. Therefore, a primary goal of the genetic evaluation in this case was to discriminate specifically between a *COL3A1*–associated syndrome and nonvascular types of the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three first-degree family members had the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, with symptoms including joint dislocations and hypermobility. However, the patient did not have joint dysfunction or objective hypermobility (i.e., she had a score of 0 on the Beighton scale of hypermobility, which ranges from 0 to 9, with a score >4 indicating generalized flexibility). There was no family history of arterial dissection, hollow viscus rupture, sudden death, or emergency vascular surgery. In short, the family history was only superficially suggestive of vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, and the patient did not appear to be affected by the familial joint condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "The absence of proximal aortic enlargement and the presence of noncystic kidneys on imaging studies in this patient reduced the likelihood of Marfan's syndrome, the Loeys–Dietz syndrome, or autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. A further consideration in this case was the absence of fibromuscular dysplasia. Monogenic vascular syndromes have not been found to be associated with a vascular morphology that is characteristic of fibromuscular dysplasia; therefore, the absence of fibromuscular dysplasia in this case somewhat increases the probability of an identifiable genetic disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither the examination nor the family history was suggestive of vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, but external inspection alone cannot completely rule out this diagnosis, and the abnormalities of the renal arteries suggested a widespread arteriopathy. Given the patient's risk profile and her desire to assess familial risk, we recommended molecular genetic testing. After formal genetic counseling was provided and written informed consent was obtained, a blood sample was obtained for testing with a comprehensive panel of genes associated with aortopathy. The testing included sequencing and deletion and duplication analysis of 23 genes reportedly involved in arterial disease, including *COL3A1* (associated with vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome), *FBN1* (associated with Marfan's syndrome), and *TGFBR2* and *SMAD3* (associated with the Loeys–Dietz syndrome). The test results, which were returned 2 weeks later, were negative. Given this patient's negative family history, unrevealing physical examination, and negative genetic testing, the possibility of a described mendelian vascular condition appears to be unlikely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Wood: On follow-up treadmill stress testing 6 weeks after presentation, the patient was able to exercise for 9 minutes. There were no diagnostic changes on electrocardiography, and she did not have chest pain. Since the time of the follow-up evaluation, she has had fleeting episodes of intermittent chest pain but no prolonged episodes. She exercises daily, feels well overall, and continues to receive a low-dose beta-blocker, aspirin, and isosorbide mononitrate.\n",

      "Any reader of the *Journal* who uses the Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital as a teaching exercise or reference material is now eligible to receive a complete set of PowerPoint slides, including digital images, with identifying legends, shown at the live Clinicopathological Conference (CPC) that is the basis of the Case Record. This slide set contains all of the images from the CPC, not only those published in the *Journal*. Radiographic, neurologic, and cardiac studies, gross specimens, and photomicrographs, as well as unpublished text slides, tables, and diagrams, are included. Every year 40 sets are produced, averaging 50-60 slides per set. Each set is supplied on a compact disc and is mailed to coincide with the publication of the Case Record. The cost of an annual subscription is $600, or individual sets may be purchased for $50 each. Application forms for the current subscription year, which began in January, may be obtained from the Lantern Slides Service, Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114 (telephone 617-726-2974) or e-mail Pathphotoslides@partners.org.\n",

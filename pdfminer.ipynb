Weems (Medicine): A 29-year-old woman was evaluated at a primary care \\nclinic affiliated with this hospital because of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\\n\\nThe patient had been in her usual state of good health until the day before \\npresentation, when nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, muscle aches, and a mild \\nnonproductive  cough  developed  suddenly.  She  had  no  sinus  congestion,  sore \\nthroat, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. Over the telephone on the morning \\nbefore  presentation,  she  reported  that  her  symptoms  were  severe  and  had  pre-\\nvented her from attending work. However, when she was evaluated later in the day \\nby a provider at her primary care clinic, she reported that she had had spontaneous \\nimprovement in the morning and felt well on arrival at the clinic.\\n\\nThe patient had a history of exercise-induced asthma, gastroesophageal reflux \\ndisease,  vitiligo,  and  genital  warts.  Two  years  before  presentation,  she  had  had \\nnegative screening tests for hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus. \\nFifteen months before presentation, she had received a diagnosis of influenza. \\nDuring the months that followed, she had reported persistent bouts of fatigue and \\nexcessive sleepiness that had resulted in two motor vehicle accidents.\\n\\nDuring the first event, which had occurred 13 months before presentation, the \\npatient fell asleep while driving and her car crossed into the other lane, over the \\ncurb, and into an open space beside the road. She did not collide with any other \\nvehicles  or  structures  and  had  no  trauma.  During  the  second  event,  which  had \\noccurred 7 months before presentation, the patient collided with a turning vehicle. \\nShe did not lose consciousness, and the airbags did not deploy. After the crash, \\nshe had intermittent painful episodes of muscle spasms in her neck and low back \\nthat limited her range of motion. She was too fatigued to seek medical attention \\nuntil the day after the collision.\\n\\nThe patient subsequently underwent evaluation at her primary care clinic.

She was referred for a for-\\nmal  sleep  study.  In  addition,  she  received  pre-\\nscriptions for naproxen and cyclobenzaprine and \\ncompleted  outpatient  physical  therapy,  and  her \\nmuscle spasms diminished.\\n\\nThe patient had not undergone any surgical \\nprocedures.  Medications  included  omeprazole, \\nvarenicline, naproxen, and cyclobenzaprine. Hydro-\\ncodone–acetaminophen had caused nausea. The \\npatient was adopted, and her family history was \\nunknown. She lived in an urban neighborhood \\nin New England with her daughter, brother, and \\nsister. She worked two full-time jobs, as a school \\ncounselor and a bartender. She smoked one pack \\nof cigarettes weekly and had done so for 17 years, \\nand she reportedly drank two to three alcoholic \\nbeverages weekly.\\n\\nOn physical examination, the temperature was \\n36.8°C, the pulse 106 beats per minute, and the \\nblood pressure 117/91 mm Hg. The weight was \\n63.5 kg, the height 170 cm, and the body-mass \\nindex  (the  weight  in  kilograms  divided  by  the \\nsquare of the height in meters) 21.9. The patient \\nappeared to be well. She had no diaphoresis or \\nrashes, needle marks, or scars. The pupils were \\nequal and reactive, the mucous membranes were \\nmoist, and the abdomen was soft, with no tender-\\nness on palpation. Results of liver-function tests \\nwere  normal,  and  testing  for  urinary  human \\nchorionic gonadotropin was negative.\\n\\nJust before the conclusion of the office visit, \\nthe patient reported a history of use of nonpre-\\nscribed oxycodone–acetaminophen tablets and re-\\nquested initiation of therapy with injectable intra-\\nmuscular naltrexone. Urine toxicology screening \\nwas ordered, and oral naltrexone was prescribed. \\nA  follow-up  visit  was  planned  for  6  days  later, \\nbut the patient did not complete the urine toxi-\\ncology screening or return to the clinic for her \\nscheduled follow-up. However, 2 months later, \\nshe  requested  a  referral  for  psychotherapy  be-\\ncause of increased symptoms of stress.\\n\\nFour months after she requested the referral \\nand 6 months after presentation, the patient was \\nseen in the outpatient psychology clinic of this \\nhospital, where additional history was obtained. \\nShe reported poor sleep, low energy, loss of in-\\nterest  in  enjoyable  activities,  feelings  of  guilt, \\nincreased appetite, and a sensation that her legs \\nwere heavy and difficult to move. She also report-\\n\\ned  intermittent  episodes  of  heightened  energy, \\npressured speech, racing thoughts, and excessive \\nspending.  She  had  no  history  of  hallucinations \\nor thoughts of harming herself or others.\\n\\nAt the psychology clinic, the patient report-\\ned that she had begun to use illicit drugs — in-\\ncluding  marijuana,  oral  opioids,  cocaine,  and \\n3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine  —  when \\nshe was in middle school. She had continued to \\nuse  multiple  substances  for  5  years  but  had \\nabruptly  discontinued  when  she  became  preg-\\nnant, at 19 years of age. She did not use illicit \\ndrugs for 8 years after the birth of her daughter \\nbut  then  resumed  regular  use  of  oral  opioids \\n3 years before presentation, when she began to \\nwork at a bar where drugs were frequently avail-\\nable.  Since  then,  she  had  used  escalating \\namounts of oral oxycodone to satisfy increased \\ncravings and prevent withdrawal symptoms.\\n\\nThe patient reported that she used 120 mg of \\noxycodone  per  day  and  spent  approximately \\n$3000 per month on oxycodone. She had missed \\nwork because of withdrawal symptoms, and she \\nworried  that  she  would  lose  custody  of  her \\ndaughter because of her drug use. She had never \\nbeen hospitalized for opioid use or had an over-\\ndose.  On  several  occasions,  she  had  used  non-\\nprescribed buprenorphine, which had alleviated \\nher withdrawal symptoms and cravings, but she \\nhad  never  tried  buprenorphine  treatment  that \\nhad been prescribed by a health care provider. In \\naddition, on several occasions, she had tried to \\ninitiate treatment with injectable intramuscular \\nnaltrexone but had been unable to abstain from \\nopioid use long enough to receive the treatment. \\nA plan was made for the patient to continue with \\noutpatient cognitive behavioral therapy and mind-\\nfulness exercises, and a follow-up visit with her \\nprimary care physician was scheduled.\\n\\nOne month later, the patient was seen by her \\nprimary  care  physician.  Oral-fluid  toxicology \\nscreening was positive for oxycodone, buprenor-\\nphine, benzoylecgonine, and cocaine; testing of \\nthe saliva was negative for fentanyl.

I suspect that the patient \\nhad some ambivalence about treatment, which is \\ncommon  among  patients  with  substance  use \\ndisorder. Despite any ambivalence, the high mor-\\ntality associated with opioid use disorder makes \\nit  imperative  to  find  an  effective  treatment  for \\nthis patient.\\n\\nTreatment for Opioid Use Disorder\\nFirst-line treatment for this patient would be one \\nof the three medications approved by the Food \\nand  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  for  the  treat-\\nment of opioid use disorder: naltrexone, metha-\\ndone, or buprenorphine. These medications lead \\nto  longer  retention  in  treatment  and  decreased \\nopioid use and opioid cravings. In a meta-analysis, \\nmethadone  and  buprenorphine  were  strongly \\nassociated with decreased rates of overdose and \\ndeath  from  any  cause.2  In  choosing  the  best \\nmedication  for  this  patient,  it  would  be  neces-\\nsary  to  have  an  understanding  of  not  only  the \\ntreatment-program requirements for each medi-\\ncation  but  also  the  patient’s  preferences  and \\nprevious experience with these medications.\\n\\nNaltrexone\\nThis patient indicated a preference for naltrexone \\n(an opioid antagonist). Oral naltrexone is avail-\\nable  in  generic  form  and  is  administered  once \\ndaily  as  a  tablet.  However,  meta-analyses  have \\nshown that oral naltrexone is no more effective \\nthan placebo in lowering the rate of opioid use \\nor increasing the rate of retention in treatment.3 \\nInjectable intramuscular naltrexone is adminis-\\ntered every 28 days by a health care provider and \\nis effective in reducing opioid cravings and illicit \\nopioid use. Prescribing naltrexone does not re-\\nquire  special  training  or  licensing,  although \\nprescribing  injectable  intramuscular  naltrexone \\noften requires prior authorization from an insur-\\nance company or collaboration with a specialty \\npharmacy.\\n\\nThe initiation of either injectable or oral nal-\\ntrexone treatment precipitates withdrawal symp-\\ntoms if the patient has not abstained from opioid \\nuse for several days before initiation. Of course, \\nabstinence  also  causes  withdrawal  symptoms, \\nwhich are a potent driver of continued substance \\nuse. Achieving the abstinence that is necessary \\nto  initiate  naltrexone  therapy  is  a  major  chal-\\nlenge;  this  explains  the  patient’s  unsuccessful \\n\\nattempts  at  treatment  with  naltrexone.  If  she \\nagain  attempts  to  undergo  treatment  with  nal-\\ntrexone, how can she and her provider work to-\\ngether  to  increase  the  likelihood  that  she  will \\ncontinue to take the medication? Before the ini-\\ntiation  of  naltrexone  treatment,  the  patient’s \\nwithdrawal  symptoms  should  be  treated  either \\nin an inpatient detoxification unit or at home on \\nan  outpatient  basis,  with  comfort  medications, \\nsocial support, and close follow-up.\\n\\nMethadone\\nIn contrast with naltrexone, methadone (a full \\nopioid agonist) is not associated with a risk of \\nprecipitated withdrawal, so abstinence before the \\ninitiation of methadone treatment is not neces-\\nsary.  However,  because  methadone  has  a  rela-\\ntively long and unpredictable half-life, the treat-\\nment must be initiated carefully. An initial low \\ndose and slow approach helps to ensure that the \\npatient  is  not  oversedated  during  the  first  sev-\\neral weeks. As a treatment for pain, methadone \\ncan  be  prescribed  and  dispensed  in  a  manner \\nsimilar to any other opioid pain medication, but \\nas a treatment for opioid use disorder, methadone \\ncan be administered to patients outside the hos-\\npital only through an opioid treatment program \\nthat is licensed and regulated at the federal and \\nstate levels.\\n\\nIf this patient were hospitalized for a reason \\nother than addiction, she could be treated with \\nmethadone for opioid withdrawal, and if on dis-\\ncharge from the hospital she were linked to an \\nopioid treatment program, she could be treated \\nwith methadone for opioid use disorder.4 Regu-\\nlations  for  opioid  treatment  programs  require \\npatients to receive methadone daily at the clinic \\nand to undergo weekly counseling, random toxi-\\ncology testing, and medical and psychiatric as-\\nsessment. Patients may earn “take home” doses \\nafter  60  days  of  documented  abstinence  and \\nwith perfect attendance of dosing and counsel-\\ning appointments. Methadone treatment through \\nan  opioid  treatment  program  is  one  potential \\noption for this patient to consider.\\n\\nBuprenorphine\\nBuprenorphine  (a  partial  opioid  agonist)  can \\nprecipitate withdrawal if the patient has not ab-\\nstained from opioid use for several hours before \\nthe first dose and has not begun to have with-\\n\\nn engl j med 380;8  nejm.org  February 21, 2019\\n\\n775\\n\\nThe New England Journal of MedicineDownloaded from nejm.org by Chelsea Joe on October 9, 2024.

Like  naltrexone,  buprenor-\\nphine can be prescribed in any clinical setting, \\nalthough to prescribe buprenorphine in an out-\\npatient setting, a waiver must be obtained from \\nthe Drug Enforcement Agency after completion \\nof additional training (8 hours for physicians and \\n24  hours  for  nurse  practitioners  and  physician \\nassistants). Buprenorphine is typically combined \\nwith naloxone in a sublingual or buccal formula-\\ntion to reduce the potential for injection or diver-\\nsion.  A  long-acting  injectable  buprenorphine \\nformulation was approved by the FDA in 2018.\\n\\nThis patient had some experience with use of \\nbuprenorphine that had been obtained by illicit \\nmeans. I would ask the patient whether she had \\nany withdrawal symptoms, sedation, or dyspho-\\nria when she took buprenorphine; whether it was \\nhelpful in reducing her oxycodone use; and how \\nwell she functioned while she took it. If buprenor-\\nphine had worked well for her, then I would ask \\nwhy she requested naltrexone rather than bupre-\\nnorphine during her primary care visit. As ago-\\nnist treatments, buprenorphine and methadone \\nare  often  stigmatized  as  “trading  one  drug  for \\nanother.” This stigma undermines the clear evi-\\ndence from multiple clinical trials that bupre-\\nnorphine and methadone therapies can break the \\naddiction cycle of compulsive use.\\n\\nRisk for Relapse\\nAdherence to treatment is a major challenge for \\npatients who receive any of these three medica-\\ntions. It is worth noting that patients who take \\nmethadone  may  have  longer  retention  in  treat-\\nment than those who take buprenorphine,5-7 and \\npatients  who  take  buprenorphine  have  longer \\nretention  than  those  who  take  naltrexone.7  In \\nthe first 4 weeks after discontinuation of these \\nmedications, there is a surge in overdose mortal-\\nity,2  which  is  driven  by  the  high  likelihood  of \\nrelapse  coupled  with  reduced  tolerance.  Before \\nthe initiation of naltrexone, methadone, or bupre-\\nnorphine treatment in this patient, it would be \\ncrucial to explain to her that she is at very high \\nrisk for relapse and overdose if she discontinues \\nthe medication.\\n\\nRegardless of the treatment that is chosen, \\nthis patient will need a strategy to reduce the \\nrisk of overdose in the event of relapse. Key ele-\\nments of an overdose risk-reduction plan include \\n\\nuse of opioids in the presence of others who are \\nequipped with naloxone and can respond if over-\\ndose  occurs;  avoidance  of  additional  sedative \\nsubstances,  such  as  benzodiazepines  and  alco-\\nhol; and administration of the opioid at the low-\\nest possible dose and slowly to test its potency. \\nIn accordance with guidance from the Depart-\\nment of Health and Human Services, a naloxone \\nrescue kit should be prescribed to this patient so \\nthat she can be prepared to respond to any over-\\ndose  that  she  witnesses  and  can  ensure  that \\nnaloxone is available to anyone who is with her \\nif she relapses.8\\n\\nOpportunities for Improving Care\\nThis case shows several ways in which the care \\nof patients with opioid use disorder can be im-\\nproved. During the patient’s previous encounters \\nwith the health care system, there were missed \\nopportunities to discuss and diagnose her opioid \\nuse  disorder.  Although  the  U.S.  Preventive  Ser-\\nvices Task Force has found insufficient evidence \\nto support universal screening for substance use \\ndisorder,9 screening was warranted in this pa-\\ntient on the basis of her history, which included \\nmultiple risk factors for substance use disorder, \\nsuch as tobacco use disorder, underlying mood \\ndisorder, fatigue and daytime drowsiness, and \\nmotor vehicle accidents. Although overdose has \\nreplaced  motor  vehicle  crashes  as  the  leading \\ncause  of  injury-related  death  in  the  United \\nStates,  this  case  reminds  us  that  a  substantial \\nproportion of motor vehicle crashes involve the \\nuse  of  substances  —  most  commonly  alcohol \\nbut increasingly other substances, such as mari-\\njuana and opioids.10\\n\\nEffective screening can be accomplished with \\none question: “How many times in the past year \\nhave you used an illegal drug or used a prescrip-\\ntion medication for nonmedical reasons?”11 In \\nthis  patient,  the  answer  to  this  question,  fol-\\nlowed by further exploration of the frequency of \\nher substance use and the quantity that she used \\neach  time  as  well  as  exploration  of  the  conse-\\nquences of her use, could have allowed her pro-\\nviders to address her substance use disorder at \\nan  earlier  stage.  When  the  patient  requested \\nmedication  for  opioid  use  disorder,  she  most \\nlikely had already met criteria for this diagnosis. \\nHowever,  it  is  useful  to  review  the  diagnostic \\n\\n776\\n\\nn engl j med 380;8  nejm.org  February 21, 2019\\n\\nThe New England Journal of MedicineDownloaded from nejm.org by Chelsea Joe on October 9, 2024.

The  criteria  will \\ncontinue  to  be  useful  for  monitoring  this  pa-\\ntient.  As  her  condition  improves,  the  number \\nof  criteria  she  meets  will  decrease,  indicating \\nreduced severity.\\n\\nNext Steps\\nThis patient has at least two promising prognos-\\ntic characteristics. First, she is seeking treatment \\nand has sought treatment in the past. It is nor-\\nmal for patients with substance use disorder to \\nhave multiple episodes of attempted treatment \\nand relapse, but over time, the relapse periods \\nshould shorten and the remission periods should \\nlengthen. Second, she abstained from drug use \\nfor years after the birth of her daughter, which \\nis a sign that she may be able to abstain in the \\nfuture.\\n\\nThe  patient  is  receiving  care  from  primary \\ncare  and  mental  health  care  providers.  Who \\nwould  best  treat  her  opioid  use  disorder?  Does \\nshe  need  specialty  treatment?  If  she  and  her \\nproviders decide that methadone is the best op-\\ntion,  then  she  will  need  to  enroll  in  an  opioid \\ntreatment program, which is typically separate \\nfrom  primary  care  and  mental  health  care.  If \\nthey choose naltrexone or buprenorphine, either \\ntreatment can be delivered effectively in the pri-\\nmary  care  or  community  mental  health  care \\nsetting.  The  patient  should  receive  care  in  the \\nsetting in which she is least likely to discontinue \\ntreatment,  thus  minimizing  her  risk  of  relapse \\nand overdose.\\n\\nDr . A l e x a nder Y. Wa l l e y ’s \\nDi agnosis\\n\\nSevere opioid use disorder.\\n\\nPathol o gic a l Discussion\\n\\nDr. George Eng: In this patient, liquid chromatog-\\nraphy–mass spectrometry of oral fluid was posi-\\ntive for oxycodone, buprenorphine, benzoylecgo-\\nnine,  and  cocaine.  Urine  is  a  more  commonly \\ntested specimen type than oral fluid, since it can \\neasily be obtained noninvasively, with the addi-\\ntional  benefit  that  drugs  of  interest  or  their \\nmetabolites  are  often  concentrated  in  it.  How-\\n\\never, urine testing for drugs of abuse is poten-\\ntially  complicated  by  deliberate  manipulation \\nof the specimen; adulteration, substitution, and \\ndilution can all affect drug detection. Although \\nan abnormal creatinine level, pH, or osmolality \\ncan suggest specimen manipulation, these mea-\\nsures are not entirely sensitive or specific.12\\n\\nIn  addition,  enzyme  immunoassays  of  urine \\nspecimens are associated with substantial rates \\nof  false  positive  results.  The  nonspecificity  of \\nenzyme  immunoassays  can  lead  to  interpretive \\ndifficulties when there is a need to distinguish \\nbetween an opiate-containing treatment regimen \\nand  illicit  opioid  use.  Thus,  many  laboratories \\nuse a two-step testing algorithm that consists of \\ninitial  screening  with  enzyme  immunoassays \\nfollowed  by  confirmation  with  liquid  chroma-\\ntography–mass spectrometry.13\\n\\nThe use of oral fluid for drug testing is also \\na  noninvasive  technique  and  may  mitigate  the \\npotential for specimen manipulation, since col-\\nlection  of  the  specimen  is  observed  directly. \\nTesting of oral fluid may be particularly useful \\nin clinical practices in which the prevalence of \\nspecimen  adulteration  is  high.14  Such  testing \\nrequires a higher degree of technical sophistica-\\ntion,  may  result  in  a  longer  turnaround  time, \\nand may not be widely available in local prac-\\ntice settings, but it is offered at reference labora-\\ntories.\\n\\nIn this patient, the results of oral-fluid test-\\ning confirmed her report of oxycodone use and \\nfurther  revealed  evidence  of  nonprescribed  bu-\\nprenorphine use. In addition, there was evidence \\nof recent cocaine use, including detection of the \\nparent molecule cocaine and the metabolite ben-\\nzoylecgonine. There was no detection of 6-mono-\\nacetylmorphine, a unique metabolite of heroin, \\nor  fentanyl,  a  common  heroin  adulterant;  to-\\ngether, these findings suggest that she was not \\nusing heroin.\\n\\nFol l ow-up\\n\\nDr. Sarah E. Wakeman: When the patient presented \\nto her primary care clinic for a follow-up visit, \\nshe described her history of opioid use and again \\nrequested  injectable  intramuscular  naltrexone. \\nIn further discussion, it became clear that she \\npreferred  naltrexone  because  of  the  stigma  re-\\n\\nn engl j med 380;8  nejm.org  February 21, 2019\\n\\n777\\n\\nThe New England Journal of MedicineDownloaded from nejm.org by Chelsea Joe on October 9, 2024.

Unobserved  initiation \\nof  buprenorphine  treatment,  also  called  home \\ninduction, has been shown to be noninferior to \\nin-office  induction  and  offers  more  flexibility \\nfor patients and providers.18 At the patient’s next \\nvisit,  she  was  connected  to  a  recovery  coach, \\nwho  offered  ongoing  peer  support.  Although \\nthere is limited research regarding the effective-\\nness  of  recovery  coaches  in  primary  care,  a \\nqualitative study showed that patients with sub-\\nstance use disorder perceive the coach to play an \\nimportant role.19\\n\\nBecause  the  patient  had  ongoing  concerns \\nabout her ability to continue treatment with bu-\\nprenorphine,  she  was  initially  hesitant  to  take \\ndoses  of  buprenorphine  and  naloxone  of  more \\nthan 8 mg and 2 mg, respectively. After initia-\\ntion of treatment, her toxicology screenings were \\nconsistently negative for opioids but she contin-\\nued to use cocaine intermittently. Eight months \\nafter initiation of treatment, she agreed to try \\nincreasing her doses of buprenorphine and nal-\\noxone to 12 mg and 3 mg, respectively, and her \\nsubsequent  toxicology  screens  were  negative \\nfor cocaine and all opioids. She is now in full, \\nsustained  remission.  She  is  working  full-time \\nand  parenting,  and  she  continues  to  engage \\nregularly  with  her  medical  team  and  recovery \\ncoach.\\n\\nA Physician: Would you comment on how you \\n\\ndetermine when to involve child protective ser-\\nvices  in  situations  in  which  a  parent  has  sub-\\nstance use disorder?\\n\\nDr. Wakeman:  In  Massachusetts,  the  criterion \\nfor mandatory reporting by a health care pro-\\nvider is having reasonable cause to believe that a \\nchild younger than 18 years of age is suffering \\nfrom abuse or neglect. I apply this standard to \\nmy patients regardless of whether they have a \\nsubstance use disorder. The parent’s use of sub-\\nstances does not necessarily mean that the child \\nis suffering from abuse or neglect. If I become \\naware of a circumstance in which a child is suf-\\nfering from abuse or neglect, then I will report \\nmy concern. If I think that it is necessary to re-\\nport, I disclose to my patients that I am report-\\ning  and  why,  so  that  they  are  aware,  although \\nthis is not required in Massachusetts.\\n\\nA Physician: At what point do you consider ta-\\n\\npering treatment for opioid use disorder?\\n\\nDr. Wakeman: The decision to taper treatment \\nshould be initiated by the patient and should be \\nbased on the clinical scenario. Tapering therapy \\nat less than 1 year typically results in recurrence \\nof active opioid use. One of the longest observa-\\ntional studies of buprenorphine for the treatment \\nof prescription-opioid use disorder, in which pa-\\ntients  were  followed  for  up  to  42  months, \\nshowed that, although many patients elected to \\ntaper  off  buprenorphine  during  the  follow-up \\nperiod, the strongest predictor of abstinence at \\n42 months was continued buprenorphine treat-\\nment. Long-term treatment with buprenorphine \\nhas  powerful  benefits.20  However,  if  a  patient \\nfeels  strongly  about  trying  to  taper  treatment \\nand has had a stable condition for years, I sug-\\ngest beginning a slow taper. If cravings develop, \\nthe dose should be increased again. I emphasize \\nto  patients  that  the  goal  is  not  to  be  off  the \\nmedication  but  to  have  what  they  need  to  stay \\nalive and healthy.\\n\\nFina l Di agnosis\\n\\nOxycodone and cocaine use.\\n\\nThis case was presented at the Harvard Medical School post-\\ngraduate course, “Primary Care Internal Medicine 2018,” directed \\nby John D.

      "Dr. John A. Weems (Medicine): A 29-year-old woman was evaluated at a primary care clinic affiliated with this hospital because of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient had been in her usual state of good health until the day before presentation, when nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, muscle aches, and a mild nonproductive cough developed suddenly. She had no sinus congestion, sore throat, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. Over the telephone on the morning before presentation, she reported that her symptoms were severe and had prevented her from attending work. However, when she was evaluated later in the day by a provider at her primary care clinic, she reported that she had had spontaneous improvement in the morning and felt well on arrival at the clinic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient had a history of exercise-induced asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vitiligo, and genital warts. Two years before presentation, she had had negative screening tests for hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus. Fifteen months before presentation, she had received a diagnosis of influenza. During the months that followed, she had reported persistent bouts of fatigue and excessive sleepiness that had resulted in two motor vehicle accidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the first event, which had occurred 13 months before presentation, the patient fell asleep while driving and her car crossed into the other lane, over the curb, and into an open space beside the road. She did not collide with any other vehicles or structures and had no trauma. During the second event, which had occurred 7 months before presentation, the patient collided with a turning vehicle. She did not lose consciousness, and the airbags did not deploy. After the crash, she had intermittent painful episodes of muscle spasms in her neck and low back that limited her range of motion. She was too fatigued to seek medical attention until the day after the collision.\n",

In addition, she received prescriptions for naproxen and cyclobenzaprine and completed outpatient physical therapy, and her muscle spasms diminished.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient had not undergone any surgical procedures. Medications included omeprazole, varenicline, naproxen, and cyclobenzaprine. Hydrocodone–acetaminophen had caused nausea. The patient was adopted, and her family history was unknown. She lived in an urban neighborhood in New England with her daughter, brother, and sister. She worked two full-time jobs, as a school counselor and a bartender. She smoked one pack of cigarettes weekly and had done so for 17 years, and she reportedly drank two to three alcoholic beverages weekly.\n",
      "\n",
      "On physical examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 106 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 117/91 mm Hg. The weight was 63.5 kg, the height 170 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.9. The patient appeared to be well. She had no diaphoresis or rashes, needle marks, or scars. The pupils were equal and reactive, the mucous membranes were moist, and the abdomen was soft, with no tenderness on palpation. Results of liver-function tests were normal, and testing for urinary human chorionic gonadotropin was negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just before the conclusion of the office visit, the patient reported a history of use of nonprescribed oxycodone–acetaminophen tablets and requested initiation of therapy with injectable intramuscular naltrexone. Urine toxicology screening was ordered, and oral naltrexone was prescribed. A follow-up visit was planned for 6 days later, but the patient did not complete the urine toxicology screening or return to the clinic for her scheduled follow-up. However, 2 months later, she requested a referral for psychotherapy because of increased symptoms of stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four months after she requested the referral and 6 months after presentation, the patient was seen in the outpatient psychology clinic of this hospital, where additional history was obtained. She reported poor sleep, low energy, loss of interest in enjoyable activities, feelings of guilt, increased appetite, and a sensation that her legs were heavy and difficult to move. She also reported intermittent episodes of heightened energy, pressured speech, racing thoughts, and excessive spending. She had no history of hallucinations or thoughts of harming herself or others.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the psychology clinic, the patient reported that she had begun to use illicit drugs - including marijuana, oral opioids, cocaine, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine - when she was in middle school. She had continued to use multiple substances for 5 years but had abruptly discontinued when she became pregnant, at 19 years of age. She did not use illicit drugs for 8 years after the birth of her daughter but then resumed regular use of oral opioids 3 years before presentation, when she began to work at a bar where drugs were frequently available.

She had missed work because of withdrawal symptoms, and she worried that she would lose custody of her daughter because of her drug use. She had never been hospitalized for opioid use or had an overdose. On several occasions, she had used nonprescribed buprenorphine, which had alleviated her withdrawal symptoms and cravings, but she had never tried buprenorphine treatment that had been prescribed by a health care provider. In addition, on several occasions, she had tried to initiate treatment with injectable intramuscular naltrexone but had been unable to abstain from opioid use long enough to receive the treatment.

At the end of the visit, she requested injectable intramuscular naltrexone, and she later described a history that fulfilled criteria for severe opioid use disorder (Table 1).1 The patient reportedly used approximately $100 worth of nonprescribed oxycodone per day and thus was at high risk for use of heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, which are more potent, widely accessible, and less expensive. However, according to the history and results of urine toxicology screening, her opioid use disorder was limited to use of illicit oxycodone. Although the patient requested naltrexone treatment, she did not complete the urine toxicology screening or return to The New England Journal of Medicine the clinic for 6 months. I suspect that the patient had some ambivalence about treatment, which is common among patients with substance use disorder. Despite any ambivalence, the high mortality associated with opioid use disorder makes it imperative to find an effective treatment for this patient.\n",

If she again attempts to undergo treatment with naltrexone, how can she and her provider work together to increase the likelihood that she will continue to take the medication? Before the initiation of naltrexone treatment, the patient's withdrawal symptoms should be treated either in an inpatient detoxification unit or at home on an outpatient basis, with comfort medications, social support, and close follow-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "First-line treatment for this patient would be one of the three medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of opioid use disorder: naltrexone, methadone, or buprenorphine. These medications lead to longer retention in treatment and decreased opioid use and opioid cravings. In a meta-analysis, methadone and buprenorphine were strongly associated with decreased rates of overdose and death from any cause.2 In choosing the best medication for this patient, it would be necessary to have an understanding of not only the treatment-program requirements for each medication but also the patient's preferences and previous experience with these medications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Naltrexone\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient indicated a preference for naltrexone (an opioid antagonist). Oral naltrexone is available in generic form and is administered once daily as a tablet. However, meta-analyses have shown that oral naltrexone is no more effective than placebo in lowering the rate of opioid use or increasing the rate of retention in treatment.3 Injectable intramuscular naltrexone is administered every 28 days by a health care provider and is effective in reducing opioid cravings and illicit opioid use. Prescribing naltrexone does not require special training or licensing, although prescribing injectable intramuscular naltrexone often requires prior authorization from an insurance company or collaboration with a specialty pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The initiation of either injectable or oral naltrexone treatment precipitates withdrawal symptoms if the patient has not abstained from opioid use for several days before initiation. Of course, abstinence also causes withdrawal symptoms, which are a potent driver of continued substance use. Achieving the abstinence that is necessary to initiate naltrexone therapy is a major challenge; this explains the patient's unsuccessful \n",
      "\n",
      "### Methadone\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast with naltrexone, methadone (a full opioid agonist) is not associated with a risk of precipitated withdrawal, so abstinence before the initiation of methadone treatment is not necessary. However, because methadone has a relatively long and unpredictable half-life, the treatment must be initiated carefully. An initial low dose and slow approach helps to ensure that the patient is not oversedated during the first several weeks. As a treatment for pain, methadone can be prescribed and dispensed in a manner similar to any other opioid pain medication, but as a treatment for opioid use disorder, methadone can be administered to patients outside the hospital only through an opioid treatment program that is licensed and regulated at the federal and state levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this patient were hospitalized for a reason other than addiction, she could be treated with methadone for opioid withdrawal, and if on discharge from the hospital she were linked to an opioid treatment program, she could be treated with methadone for opioid use disorder.4 Regulations for opioid treatment programs require patients to receive methadone daily at the clinic and to undergo weekly counseling, random toxicology testing, and medical and psychiatric assessment. Patients may earn \"take home\" doses after 60 days of documented abstinence and with perfect attendance of dosing and counseling appointments. Methadone treatment through an opioid treatment program is one potential option for this patient to consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Buprenorphine\n",
      "\n",
      "Buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist) can precipitate withdrawal if the patient has not abstained from opioid use for several hours before the first dose and has not begun to have withdrawal symptoms. Like naltrexone, buprenorphine can be prescribed in any clinical setting, although to prescribe buprenorphine in an outpatient setting, a waiver must be obtained from the Drug Enforcement Agency after completion of additional training (8 hours for physicians and 24 hours for nurse practitioners and physician assistants). Buprenorphine is typically combined with naloxone in a sublingual or buccal formulation to reduce the potential for injection or diversion. A long-acting injectable buprenorphine formulation was approved by the FDA in 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient had some experience with use of buprenorphine that had been obtained by illicit means. I would ask the patient whether she had any withdrawal symptoms, sedation, or dysphoria when she took buprenorphine; whether it was helpful in reducing her oxycodone use; and how well she functioned while she took it. If buprenorphine had worked well for her, then I would ask why she requested naltrexone rather than buprenorphine during her primary care visit. As agonist treatments, buprenorphine and methadone are often stigmatized as \"trading one drug for another.\" This stigma undermines the clear evidence from multiple clinical trials that buprenorphine and methadone therapies can break the addiction cycle of compulsive use.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Risk For Relapse\n",
      "\n",
      "Adherence to treatment is a major challenge for patients who receive any of these three medications. It is worth noting that patients who take methadone may have longer retention in treatment than those who take buprenorphine,5-7 and patients who take buprenorphine have longer retention than those who take naltrexone.7 In the first 4 weeks after discontinuation of these medications, there is a surge in overdose mortality,2 which is driven by the high likelihood of relapse coupled with reduced tolerance. Before the initiation of naltrexone, methadone, or buprenorphine treatment in this patient, it would be crucial to explain to her that she is at very high risk for relapse and overdose if she discontinues the medication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the treatment that is chosen, this patient will need a strategy to reduce the risk of overdose in the event of relapse. Key elements of an overdose risk-reduction plan include use of opioids in the presence of others who are equipped with naloxone and can respond if overdose occurs; avoidance of additional sedative substances, such as benzodiazepines and alcohol; and administration of the opioid at the lowest possible dose and slowly to test its potency. In accordance with guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services, a naloxone rescue kit should be prescribed to this patient so that she can be prepared to respond to any overdose that she witnesses and can ensure that naloxone is available to anyone who is with her if she relapses.8\n",
      "\n",
      "### Opportunities For Improving Care\n",
      "\n",
      "This case shows several ways in which the care of patients with opioid use disorder can be improved. During the patient's previous encounters with the health care system, there were missed opportunities to discuss and diagnose her opioid use disorder. Although the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has found insufficient evidence to support universal screening for substance use disorder,9 screening was warranted in this patient on the basis of her history, which included multiple risk factors for substance use disorder, such as tobacco use disorder, underlying mood disorder, fatigue and daytime drowsiness, and motor vehicle accidents. Although overdose has replaced motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States, this case reminds us that a substantial proportion of motor vehicle crashes involve the use of substances - most commonly alcohol but increasingly other substances, such as marijuana and opioids.10 Effective screening can be accomplished with one question: \"How many times in the past year have you used an illegal drug or used a prescription medication for nonmedical reasons?\"11 In this patient, the answer to this question, followed by further exploration of the frequency of her substance use and the quantity that she used each time as well as exploration of the consequences of her use, could have allowed her providers to address her substance use disorder at an earlier stage. When the patient requested medication for opioid use disorder, she most likely had already met criteria for this diagnosis. However, it is useful to review the diagnostic \n",
      "\n",
      "## 776\n",
      "\n",
      "criteria with the patient to confirm the diagnosis and its severity (Table 1). The criteria will continue to be useful for monitoring this patient. As her condition improves, the number of criteria she meets will decrease, indicating reduced severity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient has at least two promising prognostic characteristics. First, she is seeking treatment and has sought treatment in the past. It is normal for patients with substance use disorder to have multiple episodes of attempted treatment and relapse, but over time, the relapse periods should shorten and the remission periods should lengthen. Second, she abstained from drug use for years after the birth of her daughter, which is a sign that she may be able to abstain in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient is receiving care from primary care and mental health care providers. Who would best treat her opioid use disorder? Does she need specialty treatment? If she and her providers decide that methadone is the best option, then she will need to enroll in an opioid treatment program, which is typically separate from primary care and mental health care. If they choose naltrexone or buprenorphine, either treatment can be delivered effectively in the primary care or community mental health care setting. The patient should receive care in the setting in which she is least likely to discontinue treatment, thus minimizing her risk of relapse and overdose.\n",

      "## Pathological Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. George Eng: In this patient, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry of oral fluid was positive for oxycodone, buprenorphine, benzoylecgonine, and cocaine. Urine is a more commonly tested specimen type than oral fluid, since it can easily be obtained noninvasively, with the additional benefit that drugs of interest or their metabolites are often concentrated in it. However, urine testing for drugs of abuse is potentially complicated by deliberate manipulation of the specimen; adulteration, substitution, and dilution can all affect drug detection. Although an abnormal creatinine level, pH, or osmolality can suggest specimen manipulation, these measures are not entirely sensitive or specific.12 In addition, enzyme immunoassays of urine specimens are associated with substantial rates of false positive results. The nonspecificity of enzyme immunoassays can lead to interpretive difficulties when there is a need to distinguish between an opiate-containing treatment regimen and illicit opioid use. Thus, many laboratories use a two-step testing algorithm that consists of initial screening with enzyme immunoassays followed by confirmation with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry.13 The use of oral fluid for drug testing is also a noninvasive technique and may mitigate the potential for specimen manipulation, since collection of the specimen is observed directly. Testing of oral fluid may be particularly useful in clinical practices in which the prevalence of specimen adulteration is high.14 Such testing requires a higher degree of technical sophistication, may result in a longer turnaround time, and may not be widely available in local practice settings, but it is offered at reference laboratories.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this patient, the results of oral-fluid testing confirmed her report of oxycodone use and further revealed evidence of nonprescribed buprenorphine use. In addition, there was evidence of recent cocaine use, including detection of the parent molecule cocaine and the metabolite benzoylecgonine. There was no detection of 6-monoacetylmorphine, a unique metabolite of heroin, or fentanyl, a common heroin adulterant; together, these findings suggest that she was not using heroin.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Follow-Up\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Sarah E. Wakeman: When the patient presented to her primary care clinic for a follow-up visit, she described her history of opioid use and again requested injectable intramuscular naltrexone. In further discussion, it became clear that she preferred naltrexone because of the stigma re-\n",
      "\n",
      "The New England Journal of Medicine\n",
      "\n",
      "lated to buprenorphine, which she had heard from friends in recovery and observed in meetings of mutual-help organizations.15 Despite her initial preference for naltrexone, after she considered her unsuccessful previous attempts to use naltrexone and her successful experience with nonprescribed buprenorphine, she agreed to initiate buprenorphine treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient's history of nonprescribed buprenorphine use is consistent with studies that have shown that the three most commonly reported reasons for use of diverted (nonprescribed) buprenorphine are to prevent withdrawal, to maintain abstinence, and to wean off opioids.16 In addition, the outcomes associated with prescribed buprenorphine treatment are better among those who report a history of nonprescribed buprenorphine use than among those who have never taken buprenorphine.17 This patient was given instructions to start buprenorphine treatment at home, and close follow-up was arranged. Unobserved initiation of buprenorphine treatment, also called home induction, has been shown to be noninferior to in-office induction and offers more flexibility for patients and providers.18 At the patient's next visit, she was connected to a recovery coach, who offered ongoing peer support. Although there is limited research regarding the effectiveness of recovery coaches in primary care, a qualitative study showed that patients with substance use disorder perceive the coach to play an important role.19 Because the patient had ongoing concerns about her ability to continue treatment with buprenorphine, she was initially hesitant to take doses of buprenorphine and naloxone of more than 8 mg and 2 mg, respectively. After initiation of treatment, her toxicology screenings were consistently negative for opioids but she continued to use cocaine intermittently. Eight months after initiation of treatment, she agreed to try increasing her doses of buprenorphine and naloxone to 12 mg and 3 mg, respectively, and her subsequent toxicology screens were negative for cocaine and all opioids. She is now in full, sustained remission. She is working full-time and parenting, and she continues to engage regularly with her medical team and recovery coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Physician: Would you comment on how you determine when to involve child protective services in situations in which a parent has substance use disorder?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Wakeman: In Massachusetts, the criterion for mandatory reporting by a health care provider is having reasonable cause to believe that a child younger than 18 years of age is suffering from abuse or neglect. I apply this standard to my patients regardless of whether they have a substance use disorder. The parent's use of substances does not necessarily mean that the child is suffering from abuse or neglect. If I become aware of a circumstance in which a child is suffering from abuse or neglect, then I will report my concern. If I think that it is necessary to report, I disclose to my patients that I am reporting and why, so that they are aware, although this is not required in Massachusetts.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Physician: At what point do you consider tapering treatment for opioid use disorder?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Wakeman: The decision to taper treatment should be initiated by the patient and should be based on the clinical scenario. Tapering therapy at less than 1 year typically results in recurrence of active opioid use. One of the longest observational studies of buprenorphine for the treatment of prescription-opioid use disorder, in which patients were followed for up to 42 months, showed that, although many patients elected to taper off buprenorphine during the follow-up period, the strongest predictor of abstinence at 42 months was continued buprenorphine treatment. Long-term treatment with buprenorphine has powerful benefits.20 However, if a patient feels strongly about trying to taper treatment and has had a stable condition for years, I suggest beginning a slow taper. If cravings develop, the dose should be increased again. I emphasize to patients that the goal is not to be off the medication but to have what they need to stay alive and healthy.\n",

      "Dr. John A. Weems (Medicine): A 29-year-old woman was evaluated at a primary care clinic affiliated with this hospital because of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient had been in her usual state of good health until the day before presentation, when nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, muscle aches, and a mild nonproductive cough developed suddenly. She had no sinus congestion, sore throat, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. Over the telephone on the morning before presentation, she reported that her symptoms were severe and had prevented her from attending work. However, when she was evaluated later in the day by a provider at her primary care clinic, she reported that she had had spontaneous improvement in the morning and felt well on arrival at the clinic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient had a history of exercise-induced asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vitiligo, and genital warts. Two years before presentation, she had had negative screening tests for hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus. Fifteen months before presentation, she had received a diagnosis of influenza. During the months that followed, she had reported persistent bouts of fatigue and excessive sleepiness that had resulted in two motor vehicle accidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the first event, which had occurred 13 months before presentation, the patient fell asleep while driving and her car crossed into the other lane, over the curb, and into an open space beside the road. She did not collide with any other vehicles or structures and had no trauma. During the second event, which had occurred 7 months before presentation, the patient collided with a turning vehicle. She did not lose consciousness, and the airbags did not deploy. After the crash, she had intermittent painful episodes of muscle spasms in her neck and low back that limited her range of motion. She was too fatigued to seek medical attention until the day after the collision.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient subsequently underwent evaluation at her primary care clinic. Her score on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was 20, with scores ranging from 0 (low-\n",

In addition, she received prescriptions for naproxen and cyclobenzaprine and completed outpatient physical therapy, and her muscle spasms diminished.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient had not undergone any surgical procedures. Medications included omeprazole, varenicline, naproxen, and cyclobenzaprine. Hydrocodone–acetaminophen had caused nausea. The patient was adopted, and her family history was unknown. She lived in an urban neighborhood in New England with her daughter, brother, and sister. She worked two full-time jobs, as a school counselor and a bartender. She smoked one pack of cigarettes weekly and had done so for 17 years, and she reportedly drank two to three alcoholic beverages weekly.\n",
      "\n",
      "On physical examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 106 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 117/91 mm Hg. The weight was 63.5 kg, the height 170 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.9. The patient appeared to be well. She had no diaphoresis or rashes, needle marks, or scars. The pupils were equal and reactive, the mucous membranes were moist, and the abdomen was soft, with no tenderness on palpation. Results of liver-function tests were normal, and testing for urinary human chorionic gonadotropin was negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just before the conclusion of the office visit, the patient reported a history of use of nonprescribed oxycodone–acetaminophen tablets and requested initiation of therapy with injectable intramuscular naltrexone. Urine toxicology screening was ordered, and oral naltrexone was prescribed. A follow-up visit was planned for 6 days later, but the patient did not complete the urine toxicology screening or return to the clinic for her scheduled follow-up. However, 2 months later, she requested a referral for psychotherapy because of increased symptoms of stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four months after she requested the referral and 6 months after presentation, the patient was seen in the outpatient psychology clinic of this hospital, where additional history was obtained. She reported poor sleep, low energy, loss of interest in enjoyable activities, feelings of guilt, increased appetite, and a sensation that her legs were heavy and difficult to move. She also reported intermittent episodes of heightened energy, pressured speech, racing thoughts, and excessive spending. She had no history of hallucinations or thoughts of harming herself or others.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the psychology clinic, the patient reported that she had begun to use illicit drugs - including marijuana, oral opioids, cocaine, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine - when she was in middle school. She had continued to use multiple substances for 5 years but had abruptly discontinued when she became pregnant, at 19 years of age. She did not use illicit drugs for 8 years after the birth of her daughter but then resumed regular use of oral opioids 3 years before presentation, when she began to work at a bar where drugs were frequently available. Since then, she had used escalating amounts of oral oxycodone to satisfy increased cravings and prevent withdrawal symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient reported that she used 120 mg of oxycodone per day and spent approximately $3000 per month on oxycodone. She had missed work because of withdrawal symptoms, and she worried that she would lose custody of her daughter because of her drug use. She had never been hospitalized for opioid use or had an overdose. On several occasions, she had used nonprescribed buprenorphine, which had alleviated her withdrawal symptoms and cravings, but she had never tried buprenorphine treatment that had been prescribed by a health care provider. In addition, on several occasions, she had tried to initiate treatment with injectable intramuscular naltrexone but had been unable to abstain from opioid use long enough to receive the treatment. A plan was made for the patient to continue with outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness exercises, and a follow-up visit with her primary care physician was scheduled.\n",
      "\n",
      "One month later, the patient was seen by her primary care physician. Oral-fluid toxicology screening was positive for oxycodone, buprenorphine, benzoylecgonine, and cocaine; testing of the saliva was negative for fentanyl. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.\n",

      "consistent with opioid withdrawal syndrome, which had spontaneously resolved in less than 1 day. At the end of the visit, she requested injectable intramuscular naltrexone, and she later described a history that fulfilled criteria for severe opioid use disorder (Table 1).1 The patient reportedly used approximately $100 worth of nonprescribed oxycodone per day and thus was at high risk for use of heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, which are more potent, widely accessible, and less expensive. However, according to the history and results of urine toxicology screening, her opioid use disorder was limited to use of illicit oxycodone. Although the patient requested naltrexone treatment, she did not complete the urine toxicology screening or return to The New England Journal of Medicine the clinic for 6 months. I suspect that the patient had some ambivalence about treatment, which is common among patients with substance use disorder. Despite any ambivalence, the high mortality associated with opioid use disorder makes it imperative to find an effective treatment for this patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder attempts at treatment with naltrexone. If she again attempts to undergo treatment with naltrexone, how can she and her provider work together to increase the likelihood that she will continue to take the medication? Before the initiation of naltrexone treatment, the patient's withdrawal symptoms should be treated either in an inpatient detoxification unit or at home on an outpatient basis, with comfort medications, social support, and close follow-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "First-line treatment for this patient would be one of the three medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of opioid use disorder: naltrexone, methadone, or buprenorphine. These medications lead to longer retention in treatment and decreased opioid use and opioid cravings. In a meta-analysis, methadone and buprenorphine were strongly associated with decreased rates of overdose and death from any cause.2 In choosing the best medication for this patient, it would be necessary to have an understanding of not only the treatment-program requirements for each medication but also the patient's preferences and previous experience with these medications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Naltrexone\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient indicated a preference for naltrexone (an opioid antagonist). Oral naltrexone is available in generic form and is administered once daily as a tablet. However, meta-analyses have shown that oral naltrexone is no more effective than placebo in lowering the rate of opioid use or increasing the rate of retention in treatment.3 Injectable intramuscular naltrexone is administered every 28 days by a health care provider and is effective in reducing opioid cravings and illicit opioid use. Prescribing naltrexone does not require special training or licensing, although prescribing injectable intramuscular naltrexone often requires prior authorization from an insurance company or collaboration with a specialty pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The initiation of either injectable or oral naltrexone treatment precipitates withdrawal symptoms if the patient has not abstained from opioid use for several days before initiation. Of course, abstinence also causes withdrawal symptoms, which are a potent driver of continued substance use. Achieving the abstinence that is necessary to initiate naltrexone therapy is a major challenge; this explains the patient's unsuccessful \n",
      "\n",
      "### Methadone\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast with naltrexone, methadone (a full opioid agonist) is not associated with a risk of precipitated withdrawal, so abstinence before the initiation of methadone treatment is not necessary. However, because methadone has a relatively long and unpredictable half-life, the treatment must be initiated carefully. An initial low dose and slow approach helps to ensure that the patient is not oversedated during the first several weeks. As a treatment for pain, methadone can be prescribed and dispensed in a manner similar to any other opioid pain medication, but as a treatment for opioid use disorder, methadone can be administered to patients outside the hospital only through an opioid treatment program that is licensed and regulated at the federal and state levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this patient were hospitalized for a reason other than addiction, she could be treated with methadone for opioid withdrawal, and if on discharge from the hospital she were linked to an opioid treatment program, she could be treated with methadone for opioid use disorder.4 Regulations for opioid treatment programs require patients to receive methadone daily at the clinic and to undergo weekly counseling, random toxicology testing, and medical and psychiatric assessment. Patients may earn \"take home\" doses after 60 days of documented abstinence and with perfect attendance of dosing and counseling appointments. Methadone treatment through an opioid treatment program is one potential option for this patient to consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Buprenorphine\n",
      "\n",
      "Buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist) can precipitate withdrawal if the patient has not abstained from opioid use for several hours before the first dose and has not begun to have withdrawal symptoms. Like naltrexone, buprenorphine can be prescribed in any clinical setting, although to prescribe buprenorphine in an outpatient setting, a waiver must be obtained from the Drug Enforcement Agency after completion of additional training (8 hours for physicians and 24 hours for nurse practitioners and physician assistants). Buprenorphine is typically combined with naloxone in a sublingual or buccal formulation to reduce the potential for injection or diversion. A long-acting injectable buprenorphine formulation was approved by the FDA in 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient had some experience with use of buprenorphine that had been obtained by illicit means. I would ask the patient whether she had any withdrawal symptoms, sedation, or dysphoria when she took buprenorphine; whether it was helpful in reducing her oxycodone use; and how well she functioned while she took it. If buprenorphine had worked well for her, then I would ask why she requested naltrexone rather than buprenorphine during her primary care visit. As agonist treatments, buprenorphine and methadone are often stigmatized as \"trading one drug for another.\" This stigma undermines the clear evidence from multiple clinical trials that buprenorphine and methadone therapies can break the addiction cycle of compulsive use.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Risk For Relapse\n",
      "\n",
      "Adherence to treatment is a major challenge for patients who receive any of these three medications. It is worth noting that patients who take methadone may have longer retention in treatment than those who take buprenorphine,5-7 and patients who take buprenorphine have longer retention than those who take naltrexone.7 In the first 4 weeks after discontinuation of these medications, there is a surge in overdose mortality,2 which is driven by the high likelihood of relapse coupled with reduced tolerance. Before the initiation of naltrexone, methadone, or buprenorphine treatment in this patient, it would be crucial to explain to her that she is at very high risk for relapse and overdose if she discontinues the medication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the treatment that is chosen, this patient will need a strategy to reduce the risk of overdose in the event of relapse. Key elements of an overdose risk-reduction plan include use of opioids in the presence of others who are equipped with naloxone and can respond if overdose occurs; avoidance of additional sedative substances, such as benzodiazepines and alcohol; and administration of the opioid at the lowest possible dose and slowly to test its potency. In accordance with guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services, a naloxone rescue kit should be prescribed to this patient so that she can be prepared to respond to any overdose that she witnesses and can ensure that naloxone is available to anyone who is with her if she relapses.8\n",
      "\n",
      "### Opportunities For Improving Care\n",
      "\n",
      "This case shows several ways in which the care of patients with opioid use disorder can be improved. During the patient's previous encounters with the health care system, there were missed opportunities to discuss and diagnose her opioid use disorder. Although the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has found insufficient evidence to support universal screening for substance use disorder,9 screening was warranted in this patient on the basis of her history, which included multiple risk factors for substance use disorder, such as tobacco use disorder, underlying mood disorder, fatigue and daytime drowsiness, and motor vehicle accidents. Although overdose has replaced motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States, this case reminds us that a substantial proportion of motor vehicle crashes involve the use of substances - most commonly alcohol but increasingly other substances, such as marijuana and opioids.10 Effective screening can be accomplished with one question: \"How many times in the past year have you used an illegal drug or used a prescription medication for nonmedical reasons?\"11 In this patient, the answer to this question, followed by further exploration of the frequency of her substance use and the quantity that she used each time as well as exploration of the consequences of her use, could have allowed her providers to address her substance use disorder at an earlier stage. When the patient requested medication for opioid use disorder, she most likely had already met criteria for this diagnosis. However, it is useful to review the diagnostic \n",
      "\n",
      "## 776\n",
      "\n",
      "criteria with the patient to confirm the diagnosis and its severity (Table 1). The criteria will continue to be useful for monitoring this patient. As her condition improves, the number of criteria she meets will decrease, indicating reduced severity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient has at least two promising prognostic characteristics. First, she is seeking treatment and has sought treatment in the past. It is normal for patients with substance use disorder to have multiple episodes of attempted treatment and relapse, but over time, the relapse periods should shorten and the remission periods should lengthen. Second, she abstained from drug use for years after the birth of her daughter, which is a sign that she may be able to abstain in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient is receiving care from primary care and mental health care providers. Who would best treat her opioid use disorder? Does she need specialty treatment? If she and her providers decide that methadone is the best option, then she will need to enroll in an opioid treatment program, which is typically separate from primary care and mental health care. If they choose naltrexone or buprenorphine, either treatment can be delivered effectively in the primary care or community mental health care setting. The patient should receive care in the setting in which she is least likely to discontinue treatment, thus minimizing her risk of relapse and overdose.\n",

      "## Pathological Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. George Eng: In this patient, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry of oral fluid was positive for oxycodone, buprenorphine, benzoylecgonine, and cocaine. Urine is a more commonly tested specimen type than oral fluid, since it can easily be obtained noninvasively, with the additional benefit that drugs of interest or their metabolites are often concentrated in it. However, urine testing for drugs of abuse is potentially complicated by deliberate manipulation of the specimen; adulteration, substitution, and dilution can all affect drug detection. Although an abnormal creatinine level, pH, or osmolality can suggest specimen manipulation, these measures are not entirely sensitive or specific.12 In addition, enzyme immunoassays of urine specimens are associated with substantial rates of false positive results. The nonspecificity of enzyme immunoassays can lead to interpretive difficulties when there is a need to distinguish between an opiate-containing treatment regimen and illicit opioid use. Thus, many laboratories use a two-step testing algorithm that consists of initial screening with enzyme immunoassays followed by confirmation with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry.13 The use of oral fluid for drug testing is also a noninvasive technique and may mitigate the potential for specimen manipulation, since collection of the specimen is observed directly. Testing of oral fluid may be particularly useful in clinical practices in which the prevalence of specimen adulteration is high.14 Such testing requires a higher degree of technical sophistication, may result in a longer turnaround time, and may not be widely available in local practice settings, but it is offered at reference laboratories.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this patient, the results of oral-fluid testing confirmed her report of oxycodone use and further revealed evidence of nonprescribed buprenorphine use. In addition, there was evidence of recent cocaine use, including detection of the parent molecule cocaine and the metabolite benzoylecgonine. There was no detection of 6-monoacetylmorphine, a unique metabolite of heroin, or fentanyl, a common heroin adulterant; together, these findings suggest that she was not using heroin.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Follow-Up\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Sarah E. Wakeman: When the patient presented to her primary care clinic for a follow-up visit, she described her history of opioid use and again requested injectable intramuscular naltrexone. In further discussion, it became clear that she preferred naltrexone because of the stigma re-\n",
      "\n",
      "The New England Journal of Medicine\n",
      "\n",
      "lated to buprenorphine, which she had heard from friends in recovery and observed in meetings of mutual-help organizations.15 Despite her initial preference for naltrexone, after she considered her unsuccessful previous attempts to use naltrexone and her successful experience with nonprescribed buprenorphine, she agreed to initiate buprenorphine treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient's history of nonprescribed buprenorphine use is consistent with studies that have shown that the three most commonly reported reasons for use of diverted (nonprescribed) buprenorphine are to prevent withdrawal, to maintain abstinence, and to wean off opioids.16 In addition, the outcomes associated with prescribed buprenorphine treatment are better among those who report a history of nonprescribed buprenorphine use than among those who have never taken buprenorphine.17 This patient was given instructions to start buprenorphine treatment at home, and close follow-up was arranged. Unobserved initiation of buprenorphine treatment, also called home induction, has been shown to be noninferior to in-office induction and offers more flexibility for patients and providers.18 At the patient's next visit, she was connected to a recovery coach, who offered ongoing peer support. Although there is limited research regarding the effectiveness of recovery coaches in primary care, a qualitative study showed that patients with substance use disorder perceive the coach to play an important role.19 Because the patient had ongoing concerns about her ability to continue treatment with buprenorphine, she was initially hesitant to take doses of buprenorphine and naloxone of more than 8 mg and 2 mg, respectively. After initiation of treatment, her toxicology screenings were consistently negative for opioids but she continued to use cocaine intermittently. Eight months after initiation of treatment, she agreed to try increasing her doses of buprenorphine and naloxone to 12 mg and 3 mg, respectively, and her subsequent toxicology screens were negative for cocaine and all opioids. She is now in full, sustained remission. She is working full-time and parenting, and she continues to engage regularly with her medical team and recovery coach.\n",

      "A Physician: Would you comment on how you determine when to involve child protective services in situations in which a parent has substance use disorder?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Wakeman: In Massachusetts, the criterion for mandatory reporting by a health care provider is having reasonable cause to believe that a child younger than 18 years of age is suffering from abuse or neglect. I apply this standard to my patients regardless of whether they have a substance use disorder. The parent's use of substances does not necessarily mean that the child is suffering from abuse or neglect. If I become aware of a circumstance in which a child is suffering from abuse or neglect, then I will report my concern. If I think that it is necessary to report, I disclose to my patients that I am reporting and why, so that they are aware, although this is not required in Massachusetts.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Physician: At what point do you consider tapering treatment for opioid use disorder?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Wakeman: The decision to taper treatment should be initiated by the patient and should be based on the clinical scenario. Tapering therapy at less than 1 year typically results in recurrence of active opioid use. One of the longest observational studies of buprenorphine for the treatment of prescription-opioid use disorder, in which patients were followed for up to 42 months, showed that, although many patients elected to taper off buprenorphine during the follow-up period, the strongest predictor of abstinence at 42 months was continued buprenorphine treatment. Long-term treatment with buprenorphine has powerful benefits.20 However, if a patient feels strongly about trying to taper treatment and has had a stable condition for years, I suggest beginning a slow taper. If cravings develop, the dose should be increased again. I emphasize to patients that the goal is not to be off the medication but to have what they need to stay alive and healthy.\n",

      "### Presentation of Case\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. John A. Weems (Medicine): A 29-year-old woman was evaluated at a primary care clinic affiliated with this hospital because of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient had been in her usual state of good health until the day before presentation, when nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, muscle aches, and a mild nonproductive cough developed suddenly. She had no sinus congestion, sore throat, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. Over the telephone on the morning before presentation, she reported that her symptoms were severe and had prevented her from attending work. However, when she was evaluated later in the day by a provider at her primary care clinic, she reported that she had had spontaneous improvement in the morning and felt well on arrival at the clinic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient had a history of exercise-induced asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vitiligo, and genital warts. Two years before presentation, she had had negative screening tests for hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus. Fifteen months before presentation, she had received a diagnosis of influenza. During the months that followed, she had reported persistent bouts of fatigue and excessive sleepiness that had resulted in two motor vehicle accidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the first event, which had occurred 13 months before presentation, the patient fell asleep while driving and her car crossed into the other lane, over the curb, and into an open space beside the road. She did not collide with any other vehicles or structures and had no trauma. During the second event, which had occurred 7 months before presentation, the patient collided with a turning vehicle. She did not lose consciousness, and the airbags did not deploy. After the crash, she had intermittent painful episodes of muscle spasms in her neck and low back that limited her range of motion. She was too fatigued to seek medical attention until the day after the collision.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient subsequently underwent evaluation at her primary care clinic. Her score on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was 20, with scores ranging from 0 (low-normal daytime sleepiness) to 24 (excessive daytime sleepiness). She was referred for a formal sleep study. In addition, she received prescriptions for naproxen and cyclobenzaprine and completed outpatient physical therapy, and her muscle spasms diminished.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient had not undergone any surgical procedures. Medications included omeprazole, varenicline, naproxen, and cyclobenzaprine. Hydrocodone–acetaminophen had caused nausea. The patient was adopted, and her family history was unknown. She lived in an urban neighborhood in New England with her daughter, brother, and sister. She worked two full-time jobs, as a school counselor and a bartender. She smoked one pack of cigarettes weekly and had done so for 17 years, and she reportedly drank two to three alcoholic beverages weekly.\n",
      "\n",
      "On physical examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 106 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 117/91 mm Hg. The weight was 63.5 kg, the height 170 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.9. The patient appeared to be well. She had no diaphoresis or rashes, needle marks, or scars. The pupils were equal and reactive, the mucous membranes were moist, and the abdomen was soft, with no tenderness on palpation. Results of liver-function tests were normal, and testing for urinary human chorionic gonadotropin was negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just before the conclusion of the office visit, the patient reported a history of use of nonprescribed oxycodone–acetaminophen tablets and requested initiation of therapy with injectable intramuscular naltrexone. Urine toxicology screening was ordered, and oral naltrexone was prescribed. A follow-up visit was planned for 6 days later, but the patient did not complete the urine toxicology screening or return to the clinic for her scheduled follow-up. However, 2 months later, she requested a referral for psychotherapy because of increased symptoms of stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four months after she requested the referral and 6 months after presentation, the patient was seen in the outpatient psychology clinic of this hospital, where additional history was obtained. She reported poor sleep, low energy, loss of interest in enjoyable activities, feelings of guilt, increased appetite, and a sensation that her legs were heavy and difficult to move. She also reported intermittent episodes of heightened energy, pressured speech, racing thoughts, and excessive spending. She had no history of hallucinations or thoughts of harming herself or others.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the psychology clinic, the patient reported that she had begun to use illicit drugs — including marijuana, oral opioids, cocaine, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine — when she was in middle school. She had continued to use multiple substances for 5 years but had abruptly discontinued when she became pregnant, at 19 years of age. She did not use illicit drugs for 8 years after the birth of her daughter but then resumed regular use of oral opioids 3 years before presentation, when she began to work at a bar where drugs were frequently available. Since then, she had used escalating amounts of oral oxycodone to satisfy increased cravings and prevent withdrawal symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient reported that she used 120 mg of oxycodone per day and spent approximately $3000 per month on oxycodone. She had missed work because of withdrawal symptoms, and she worried that she would lose custody of her daughter because of her drug use. She had never been hospitalized for opioid use or had an overdose. On several occasions, she had used nonprescribed buprenorphine, which had alleviated her withdrawal symptoms and cravings, but she had never tried buprenorphine treatment that had been prescribed by a health care provider. In addition, on several occasions, she had tried to initiate treatment with injectable intramuscular naltrexone but had been unable to abstain from opioid use long enough to receive the treatment. A plan was made for the patient to continue with outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness exercises, and a follow-up visit with her primary care physician was scheduled.\n",
      "\n",
      "One month later, the patient was seen by her primary care physician. Oral-fluid toxicology screening was positive for oxycodone, buprenorphine, benzoylecgonine, and cocaine; testing of the saliva was negative for fentanyl. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Diagnosis and Management\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Alexander Y. Walley: I am aware of the diagnosis in this case. This 29-year-old woman presented to her primary care clinic after she had symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal syndrome, which had spontaneously resolved in less than 1 day. At the end of the visit, she requested injectable intramuscular naltrexone, and she later described a history that fulfilled criteria for severe opioid use disorder (Table 1). The patient reportedly used approximately $100 worth of nonprescribed oxycodone per day and thus was at high risk for use of heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, which are more potent, widely accessible, and less expensive. However, according to the history and results of urine toxicology screening, her opioid use disorder was limited to use of illicit oxycodone. Although the patient requested naltrexone treatment, she did not complete the urine toxicology screening or return to the clinic for 6 months. I suspect that the patient had some ambivalence about treatment, which is common among patients with substance use disorder. Despite any ambivalence, the high mortality associated with opioid use disorder makes it imperative to find an effective treatment for this patient.\n",

      "\n",
      "†Persons who are receiving prescribed opioids may meet these criteria but would not necessarily be considered to have opioid use disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder\n",
      "\n",
      "First-line treatment for this patient would be one of the three medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of opioid use disorder: naltrexone, methadone, or buprenorphine. These medications lead to longer retention in treatment and decreased opioid use and opioid cravings. In a meta-analysis, methadone and buprenorphine were strongly associated with decreased rates of overdose and death from any cause. In choosing the best medication for this patient, it would be necessary to have an understanding of not only the treatment-program requirements for each medication but also the patient's preferences and previous experience with these medications.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Naltrexone\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient indicated a preference for naltrexone (an opioid antagonist). Oral naltrexone is available in generic form and is administered once daily as a tablet. However, meta-analyses have shown that oral naltrexone is no more effective than placebo in lowering the rate of opioid use or increasing the rate of retention in treatment. Injectable intramuscular naltrexone is administered every 28 days by a health care provider and is effective in reducing opioid cravings and illicit opioid use. Prescribing naltrexone does not require special training or licensing, although prescribing injectable intramuscular naltrexone often requires prior authorization from an insurance company or collaboration with a specialty pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The initiation of either injectable or oral naltrexone treatment precipitates withdrawal symptoms if the patient has not abstained from opioid use for several days before initiation. Of course, abstinence also causes withdrawal symptoms, which are a potent driver of continued substance use. Achieving the abstinence that is necessary to initiate naltrexone therapy is a major challenge; this explains the patient's unsuccessful attempts at treatment with naltrexone. If she again attempts to undergo treatment with naltrexone, how can she and her provider work together to increase the likelihood that she will continue to take the medication? Before the initiation of naltrexone treatment, the patient's withdrawal symptoms should be treated either in an inpatient detoxification unit or at home on an outpatient basis, with comfort medications, social support, and close follow-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Methadone\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast with naltrexone, methadone (a full opioid agonist) is not associated with a risk of precipitated withdrawal, so abstinence before the initiation of methadone treatment is not necessary. However, because methadone has a relatively long and unpredictable half-life, the treatment must be initiated carefully. An initial low dose and slow approach helps to ensure that the patient is not oversedated during the first several weeks. As a treatment for pain, methadone can be prescribed and dispensed in a manner similar to any other opioid pain medication, but as a treatment for opioid use disorder, methadone can be administered to patients outside the hospital only through an opioid treatment program that is licensed and regulated at the federal and state levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this patient were hospitalized for a reason other than addiction, she could be treated with methadone for opioid withdrawal, and if on discharge from the hospital she were linked to an opioid treatment program, she could be treated with methadone for opioid use disorder. Regulations for opioid treatment programs require patients to receive methadone daily at the clinic and to undergo weekly counseling, random toxicology testing, and medical and psychiatric assessment. Patients may earn \"take home\" doses after 60 days of documented abstinence and with perfect attendance of dosing and counseling appointments. Methadone treatment through an opioid treatment program is one potential option for this patient to consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Buprenorphine\n",
      "\n",
      "Buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist) can precipitate withdrawal if the patient has not abstained from opioid use for several hours before the first dose and has not begun to have withdrawal symptoms. Like naltrexone, buprenorphine can be prescribed in any clinical setting, although to prescribe buprenorphine in an outpatient setting, a waiver must be obtained from the Drug Enforcement Agency after completion of additional training (8 hours for physicians and 24 hours for nurse practitioners and physician assistants). Buprenorphine is typically combined with naloxone in a sublingual or buccal formulation to reduce the potential for injection or diversion. A long-acting injectable buprenorphine formulation was approved by the FDA in 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient had some experience with use of buprenorphine that had been obtained by illicit means. I would ask the patient whether she had any withdrawal symptoms, sedation, or dysphoria when she took buprenorphine; whether it was helpful in reducing her oxycodone use; and how well she functioned while she took it. If buprenorphine had worked well for her, then I would ask why she requested naltrexone rather than buprenorphine during her primary care visit. As agonist treatments, buprenorphine and methadone are often stigmatized as \"trading one drug for another.\" This stigma undermines the clear evidence from multiple clinical trials that buprenorphine and methadone therapies can break the addiction cycle of compulsive use.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Risk for Relapse\n",
      "\n",
      "Adherence to treatment is a major challenge for patients who receive any of these three medications. It is worth noting that patients who take methadone may have longer retention in treatment than those who take buprenorphine, and patients who take buprenorphine have longer retention than those who take naltrexone. In the first 4 weeks after discontinuation of these medications, there is a surge in overdose mortality, which is driven by the high likelihood of relapse coupled with reduced tolerance. Before the initiation of naltrexone, methadone, or buprenorphine treatment in this patient, it would be crucial to explain to her that she is at very high risk for relapse and overdose if she discontinues the medication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the treatment that is chosen, this patient will need a strategy to reduce the risk of overdose in the event of relapse. Key elements of an overdose risk-reduction plan include use of opioids in the presence of others who are equipped with naloxone and can respond if overdose occurs; avoidance of additional sedative substances, such as benzodiazepines and alcohol; and administration of the opioid at the lowest possible dose and slowly to test its potency. In accordance with guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services, a naloxone rescue kit should be prescribed to this patient so that she can be prepared to respond to any overdose that she witnesses and can ensure that naloxone is available to anyone who is with her if she relapses.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Opportunities for Improving Care\n",
      "\n",
      "This case shows several ways in which the care of patients with opioid use disorder can be improved. During the patient's previous encounters with the health care system, there were missed opportunities to discuss and diagnose her opioid use disorder. Although the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has found insufficient evidence to support universal screening for substance use disorder, screening was warranted in this patient on the basis of her history, which included multiple risk factors for substance use disorder, such as tobacco use disorder, underlying mood disorder, fatigue and daytime drowsiness, and motor vehicle accidents. Although overdose has replaced motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States, this case reminds us that a substantial proportion of motor vehicle crashes involve the use of substances — most commonly alcohol but increasingly other substances, such as marijuana and opioids. Effective screening can be accomplished with one question: \"How many times in the past year have you used an illegal drug or used a prescription medication for nonmedical reasons?\" In this patient, the answer to this question, followed by further exploration of the frequency of her substance use and the quantity that she used each time as well as exploration of the consequences of her use, could have allowed her providers to address her substance use disorder at an earlier stage. When the patient requested medication for opioid use disorder, she most likely had already met criteria for this diagnosis. However, it is useful to review the diagnostic criteria with the patient to confirm the diagnosis and its severity (Table 1). The criteria will continue to be useful for monitoring this patient. As her condition improves, the number of criteria she meets will decrease, indicating reduced severity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient has at least two promising prognostic characteristics. First, she is seeking treatment and has sought treatment in the past. It is normal for patients with substance use disorder to have multiple episodes of attempted treatment and relapse, but over time, the relapse periods should shorten and the remission periods should lengthen. Second, she abstained from drug use for years after the birth of her daughter, which is a sign that she may be able to abstain in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient is receiving care from primary care and mental health care providers. Who would best treat her opioid use disorder? Does she need specialty treatment? If she and her providers decide that methadone is the best option, then she will need to enroll in an opioid treatment program, which is typically separate from primary care and mental health care. If they choose naltrexone or buprenorphine, either treatment can be delivered effectively in the primary care or community mental health care setting. The patient should receive care in the setting in which she is least likely to discontinue treatment, thus minimizing her risk of relapse and overdose.\n",

      "## Pathological Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. George Eng: In this patient, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry of oral fluid was positive for oxycodone, buprenorphine, benzoylecgonine, and cocaine. Urine is a more commonly tested specimen type than oral fluid, since it can easily be obtained noninvasively, with the additional benefit that drugs of interest or their metabolites are often concentrated in it. However, urine testing for drugs of abuse is potentially complicated by deliberate manipulation of the specimen; adulteration, substitution, and dilution can all affect drug detection. Although an abnormal creatinine level, pH, or osmolality can suggest specimen manipulation, these measures are not entirely sensitive or specific.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, enzyme immunoassays of urine specimens are associated with substantial rates of false positive results. The nonspecificity of enzyme immunoassays can lead to interpretive difficulties when there is a need to distinguish between an opiate-containing treatment regimen and illicit opioid use. Thus, many laboratories use a two-step testing algorithm that consists of initial screening with enzyme immunoassays followed by confirmation with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. The use of oral fluid for drug testing is also a noninvasive technique and may mitigate the potential for specimen manipulation, since collection of the specimen is observed directly. Testing of oral fluid may be particularly useful in clinical practices in which the prevalence of specimen adulteration is high. Such testing requires a higher degree of technical sophistication, may result in a longer turnaround time, and may not be widely available in local practice settings, but it is offered at reference laboratories.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this patient, the results of oral-fluid testing confirmed her report of oxycodone use and further revealed evidence of nonprescribed buprenorphine use. In addition, there was evidence of recent cocaine use, including detection of the parent molecule cocaine and the metabolite benzoylecgonine. There was no detection of 6-monoacetylmorphine, a unique metabolite of heroin, or fentanyl, a common heroin adulterant; together, these findings suggest that she was not using heroin.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Follow-Up\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Sarah E. Wakeman: When the patient presented to her primary care clinic for a follow-up visit, she described her history of opioid use and again requested injectable intramuscular naltrexone. In further discussion, it became clear that she preferred naltrexone because of the stigma related to buprenorphine, which she had heard from friends in recovery and observed in meetings of mutual-help organizations. Despite her initial preference for naltrexone, after she considered her unsuccessful previous attempts to use naltrexone and her successful experience with nonprescribed buprenorphine, she agreed to initiate buprenorphine treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient's history of nonprescribed buprenorphine use is consistent with studies that have shown that the three most commonly reported reasons for use of diverted (nonprescribed) buprenorphine are to prevent withdrawal, to maintain abstinence, and to wean off opioids. In addition, the outcomes associated with prescribed buprenorphine treatment are better among those who report a history of nonprescribed buprenorphine use than among those who have never taken buprenorphine. This patient was given instructions to start buprenorphine treatment at home, and close follow-up was arranged. Unobserved initiation of buprenorphine treatment, also called home induction, has been shown to be noninferior to in-office induction and offers more flexibility for patients and providers. At the patient's next visit, she was connected to a recovery coach, who offered ongoing peer support. Although there is limited research regarding the effectiveness of recovery coaches in primary care, a qualitative study showed that patients with substance use disorder perceive the coach to play an important role. Because the patient had ongoing concerns about her ability to continue treatment with buprenorphine, she was initially hesitant to take doses of buprenorphine and naloxone of more than 8 mg and 2 mg, respectively. After initiation of treatment, her toxicology screenings were consistently negative for opioids but she continued to use cocaine intermittently. Eight months after initiation of treatment, she agreed to try increasing her doses of buprenorphine and naloxone to 12 mg and 3 mg, respectively, and her subsequent toxicology screens were negative for cocaine and all opioids. She is now in full, sustained remission. She is working full-time and parenting, and she continues to engage regularly with her medical team and recovery coach.\n",

      "#### A Physician: Would you comment on how you determine when to involve child protective services in situations in which a parent has substance use disorder?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Wakeman: In Massachusetts, the criterion for mandatory reporting by a health care provider is having reasonable cause to believe that a child younger than 18 years of age is suffering from abuse or neglect. I apply this standard to my patients regardless of whether they have a substance use disorder. The parent's use of substances does not necessarily mean that the child is suffering from abuse or neglect. If I become aware of a circumstance in which a child is suffering from abuse or neglect, then I will report my concern. If I think that it is necessary to report, I disclose to my patients that I am reporting and why, so that they are aware, although this is not required in Massachusetts.\n",

      "#### A Physician: At what point do you consider tapering treatment for opioid use disorder?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Wakeman: The decision to taper treatment should be initiated by the patient and should be based on the clinical scenario. Tapering therapy at less than 1 year typically results in recurrence of active opioid use. One of the longest observational studies of buprenorphine for the treatment of prescription-opioid use disorder, in which patients were followed for up to 42 months, showed that, although many patients elected to taper off buprenorphine during the follow-up period, the strongest predictor of abstinence at 42 months was continued buprenorphine treatment. Long-term treatment with buprenorphine has powerful benefits. However, if a patient feels strongly about trying to taper treatment and has had a stable condition for years, I suggest beginning a slow taper. If cravings develop, the dose should be increased again. I emphasize to patients that the goal is not to be off the medication but to have what they need to stay alive and healthy.\n",
